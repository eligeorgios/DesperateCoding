<blockquote>
17:1 My breath is corrupt, my days are extinct, the graves are ready for me.<br>
<br>
17:2 Are there not mockers with me? and doth not mine eye continue in their provocation?<br>
<br>
17:3 Lay down now, put me in a surety with thee; who is he that will strike hands with me?<br>
<br>
17:4 For thou hast hid their heart from understanding: therefore shalt thou not exalt them.<br>
<br>
17:5 He that speaketh flattery to his friends, even the eyes of his children shall fail.<br>
<br>
17:6 He hath made me also a byword of the people; and aforetime I was as a tabret.<br>
<br>
17:7 Mine eye also is dim by reason of sorrow, and all my members are as a shadow.<br>
<br>
17:8 Upright men shall be astonied at this, and the innocent shall stir up himself against the hypocrite.<br>
<br>
17:9 The righteous also shall hold on his way, and he that hath clean hands shall be stronger and stronger.<br>
<br>
17:10 But as for you all, do ye return, and come now: for I cannot find one wise man among you.<br>
<br>
17:11 My days are past, my purposes are broken off, even the thoughts of my heart.<br>
<br>
17:12 They change the night into day: the light is short because of darkness.<br>
<br>
17:13 If I wait, the grave is mine house: I have made my bed in the darkness.<br>
<br>
17:14 I have said to corruption, Thou art my father: to the worm, Thou art my mother, and my sister.<br>
<br>
17:15 And where is now my hope? as for my hope, who shall see it?<br>
<br>
17:16 They shall go down to the bars of the pit, when our rest together is in the dust.<br>
<br>
