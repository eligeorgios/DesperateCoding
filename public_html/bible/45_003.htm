<blockquote>
3:1 What advantage then hath the Jew? or what profit is there of circumcision?<br>
<br>
3:2 Much every way: chiefly, because that unto them were committed the oracles of God.<br>
<br>
3:3 For what if some did not believe? shall their unbelief make the faith of God without effect?<br>
<br>
3:4 God forbid: yea, let God be true, but every man a liar; as it is written, That thou mightest be justified in thy sayings, and mightest overcome when thou art judged.<br>
<br>
3:5 But if our unrighteousness commend the righteousness of God, what shall we say? Is God unrighteous who taketh vengeance? (I speak as a man)<br>
<br>
3:6 God forbid: for then how shall God judge the world?<br>
<br>
3:7 For if the truth of God hath more abounded through my lie unto his glory; why yet am I also judged as a sinner?<br>
<br>
3:8 And not rather, (as we be slanderously reported, and as some affirm that we say,) Let us do evil, that good may come? whose damnation is just.<br>
<br>
3:9 What then? are we better than they? No, in no wise: for we have before proved both Jews and Gentiles, that they are all under sin;<br>
<br>
3:10 As it is written, There is none righteous, no, not one:<br>
<br>
3:11 There is none that understandeth, there is none that seeketh after God.<br>
<br>
3:12 They are all gone out of the way, they are together become unprofitable; there is none that doeth good, no, not one.<br>
<br>
3:13 Their throat is an open sepulchre; with their tongues they have used deceit; the poison of asps is under their lips:<br>
<br>
3:14 Whose mouth is full of cursing and bitterness:<br>
<br>
3:15 Their feet are swift to shed blood:<br>
<br>
3:16 Destruction and misery are in their ways:<br>
<br>
3:17 And the way of peace have they not known:<br>
<br>
3:18 There is no fear of God before their eyes.<br>
<br>
3:19 Now we know that what things soever the law saith, it saith to them who are under the law: that every mouth may be stopped, and all the world may become guilty before God.<br>
<br>
3:20 Therefore by the deeds of the law there shall no flesh be justified in his sight: for by the law is the knowledge of sin.<br>
<br>
3:21 But now the righteousness of God without the law is manifested, being witnessed by the law and the prophets;<br>
<br>
3:22 Even the righteousness of God which is by faith of Jesus Christ unto all and upon all them that believe: for there is no difference:<br>
<br>
3:23 For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;<br>
<br>
3:24 Being justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus:<br>
<br>
3:25 Whom God hath set forth to be a propitiation through faith in his blood, to declare his righteousness for the remission of sins that are past, through the forbearance of God;<br>
<br>
3:26 To declare, I say, at this time his righteousness: that he might be just, and the justifier of him which believeth in Jesus.<br>
<br>
3:27 Where is boasting then? It is excluded. By what law? of works? Nay: but by the law of faith.<br>
<br>
3:28 Therefore we conclude that a man is justified by faith without the deeds of the law.<br>
<br>
3:29 Is he the God of the Jews only? is he not also of the Gentiles? Yes, of the Gentiles also:<br>
<br>
3:30 Seeing it is one God, which shall justify the circumcision by faith, and uncircumcision through faith.<br>
<br>
3:31 Do we then make void the law through faith? God forbid: yea, we establish the law.<br>
