<blockquote>
2:1 I lifted up mine eyes again, and looked, and behold a man with a measuring line in his hand.<br>
<br>
2:2 Then said I, Whither goest thou? And he said unto me, To measure Jerusalem, to see what is the breadth thereof, and what is the length thereof.<br>
<br>
2:3 And, behold, the angel that talked with me went forth, and another angel went out to meet him,<br>
<br>
2:4 And said unto him, Run, speak to this young man, saying, Jerusalem shall be inhabited as towns without walls for the multitude of men and cattle therein:<br>
<br>
2:5 For I, saith the LORD, will be unto her a wall of fire round about, and will be the glory in the midst of her.<br>
<br>
2:6 Ho, ho, come forth, and flee from the land of the north, saith the LORD: for I have spread you abroad as the four winds of the heaven, saith the LORD.<br>
<br>
2:7 Deliver thyself, O Zion, that dwellest with the daughter of Babylon.<br>
<br>
2:8 For thus saith the LORD of hosts; After the glory hath he sent me unto the nations which spoiled you: for he that toucheth you toucheth the apple of his eye.<br>
<br>
2:9 For, behold, I will shake mine hand upon them, and they shall be a spoil to their servants: and ye shall know that the LORD of hosts hath sent me.<br>
<br>
2:10 Sing and rejoice, O daughter of Zion: for, lo, I come, and I will dwell in the midst of thee, saith the LORD.<br>
<br>
2:11 And many nations shall be joined to the LORD in that day, and shall be my people: and I will dwell in the midst of thee, and thou shalt know that the LORD of hosts hath sent me unto thee.<br>
<br>
2:12 And the LORD shall inherit Judah his portion in the holy land, and shall choose Jerusalem again.<br>
<br>
2:13 Be silent, O all flesh, before the LORD: for he is raised up out of his holy habitation.<br>
