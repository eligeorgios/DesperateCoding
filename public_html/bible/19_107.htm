<blockquote>
107:1 O give thanks unto the LORD, for he is good: for his mercy endureth for ever.<br>
<br>
107:2 Let the redeemed of the LORD say so, whom he hath redeemed from the hand of the enemy;<br>
<br>
107:3 And gathered them out of the lands, from the east, and from the west, from the north, and from the south.<br>
<br>
107:4 They wandered in the wilderness in a solitary way; they found no city to dwell in.<br>
<br>
107:5 Hungry and thirsty, their soul fainted in them.<br>
<br>
107:6 Then they cried unto the LORD in their trouble, and he delivered them out of their distresses.<br>
<br>
107:7 And he led them forth by the right way, that they might go to a city of habitation.<br>
<br>
107:8 Oh that men would praise the LORD for his goodness, and for his wonderful works to the children of men!<br>
<br>
107:9 For he satisfieth the longing soul, and filleth the hungry soul with goodness.<br>
<br>
107:10 Such as sit in darkness and in the shadow of death, being bound in affliction and iron;<br>
<br>
107:11 Because they rebelled against the words of God, and contemned the counsel of the most High:<br>
<br>
107:12 Therefore he brought down their heart with labour; they fell down, and there was none to help.<br>
<br>
107:13 Then they cried unto the LORD in their trouble, and he saved them out of their distresses.<br>
<br>
107:14 He brought them out of darkness and the shadow of death, and brake their bands in sunder.<br>
<br>
107:15 Oh that men would praise the LORD for his goodness, and for his wonderful works to the children of men!<br>
<br>
107:16 For he hath broken the gates of brass, and cut the bars of iron in sunder.<br>
<br>
107:17 Fools because of their transgression, and because of their iniquities, are afflicted.<br>
<br>
107:18 Their soul abhorreth all manner of meat; and they draw near unto the gates of death.<br>
<br>
107:19 Then they cry unto the LORD in their trouble, and he saveth them out of their distresses.<br>
<br>
107:20 He sent his word, and healed them, and delivered them from their destructions.<br>
<br>
107:21 Oh that men would praise the LORD for his goodness, and for his wonderful works to the children of men!<br>
<br>
107:22 And let them sacrifice the sacrifices of thanksgiving, and declare his works with rejoicing.<br>
<br>
107:23 They that go down to the sea in ships, that do business in great waters;<br>
<br>
107:24 These see the works of the LORD, and his wonders in the deep.<br>
<br>
107:25 For he commandeth, and raiseth the stormy wind, which lifteth up the waves thereof.<br>
<br>
107:26 They mount up to the heaven, they go down again to the depths: their soul is melted because of trouble.<br>
<br>
107:27 They reel to and fro, and stagger like a drunken man, and are at their wit's end.<br>
<br>
107:28 Then they cry unto the LORD in their trouble, and he bringeth them out of their distresses.<br>
<br>
107:29 He maketh the storm a calm, so that the waves thereof are still.<br>
<br>
107:30 Then are they glad because they be quiet; so he bringeth them unto their desired haven.<br>
<br>
107:31 Oh that men would praise the LORD for his goodness, and for his wonderful works to the children of men!<br>
<br>
107:32 Let them exalt him also in the congregation of the people, and praise him in the assembly of the elders.<br>
<br>
107:33 He turneth rivers into a wilderness, and the watersprings into dry ground;<br>
<br>
107:34 A fruitful land into barrenness, for the wickedness of them that dwell therein.<br>
<br>
107:35 He turneth the wilderness into a standing water, and dry ground into watersprings.<br>
<br>
107:36 And there he maketh the hungry to dwell, that they may prepare a city for habitation;<br>
<br>
107:37 And sow the fields, and plant vineyards, which may yield fruits of increase.<br>
<br>
107:38 He blesseth them also, so that they are multiplied greatly; and suffereth not their cattle to decrease.<br>
<br>
107:39 Again, they are minished and brought low through oppression, affliction, and sorrow.<br>
<br>
107:40 He poureth contempt upon princes, and causeth them to wander in the wilderness, where there is no way.<br>
<br>
107:41 Yet setteth he the poor on high from affliction, and maketh him families like a flock.<br>
<br>
107:42 The righteous shall see it, and rejoice: and all iniquity shall stop her mouth.<br>
<br>
107:43 Whoso is wise, and will observe these things, even they shall understand the lovingkindness of the LORD.<br>
