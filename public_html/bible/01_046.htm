<br>
46:2 And God spake unto Israel in the visions of the night, and said, Jacob, Jacob. And he said, Here am I.<br>
<br>
46:3 And he said, I am God, the God of thy father: fear not to go down into Egypt; for I will there make of thee a great nation:<br>
<br>
46:4 I will go down with thee into Egypt; and I will also surely bring thee up again: and Joseph shall put his hand upon thine eyes.<br>
<br>

<br>
46:6 And they took their cattle, and their goods, which they had gotten in the land of Canaan, and came into Egypt, Jacob, and all his seed with him:<br>

46:7 His sons, and his sons' sons with him, his daughters, and his sons' daughters, and all his seed brought he with him into Egypt.<br>
<br>

46:11 And the sons of Levi; Gershon, Kohath, and Merari.<br>
<br>

<br>
46:24 And the sons of Naphtali; Jahzeel, and Guni, and Jezer, and Shillem.<br>
<br>
46:25 These are the sons of Bilhah, which Laban gave unto Rachel his daughter, and she bare these unto Jacob: all the souls were seven.<br>
<br>
46:26 All the souls that came with Jacob into Egypt, which came out of his loins, besides Jacob's sons' wives, all the souls were threescore and six;<br>
<br>
46:27 And the sons of Joseph, which were born him in Egypt, were two souls: all the souls of the house of Jacob, which came into Egypt, were threescore and ten.<br>
<br>
46:28 And he sent Judah before him unto Joseph, to direct his face unto Goshen; and they came into the land of Goshen.<br>
<br>
46:29 And Joseph made ready his chariot, and went up to meet Israel his father, to Goshen, and presented himself unto him; and he fell on his neck, and wept on his neck a good while.<br>
<br>
46:30 And Israel said unto Joseph, Now let me die, since I have seen thy face, because thou art yet alive.<br>
<br>
46:31 And Joseph said unto his brethren, and unto his father's house, I will go up, and show Pharaoh, and say unto him, My brethren, and my father's house, which were in the land of Canaan, are come unto me;<br>
<br>
46:32 And the men are shepherds, for their trade hath been to feed cattle; and they have brought their flocks, and their herds, and all that they have.<br>
<br>
46:33 And it shall come to pass, when Pharaoh shall call you, and shall say, What is your occupation?<br>
<br>
46:34 That ye shall say, Thy servants' trade hath been about cattle from our youth even until now, both we, and also our fathers: that ye may dwell in the land of Goshen; for every shepherd is an abomination unto the Egyptians.<br>
