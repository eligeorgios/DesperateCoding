<blockquote>
105:1 O give thanks unto the LORD; call upon his name: make known his deeds among the people.<br>
<br>
105:2 Sing unto him, sing psalms unto him: talk ye of all his wondrous works.<br>
<br>
105:3 Glory ye in his holy name: let the heart of them rejoice that seek the LORD.<br>
<br>
105:4 Seek the LORD, and his strength: seek his face evermore.<br>
<br>
105:5 Remember his marvellous works that he hath done; his wonders, and the judgments of his mouth;<br>
<br>
105:6 O ye seed of Abraham his servant, ye children of Jacob his chosen.<br>
<br>
105:7 He is the LORD our God: his judgments are in all the earth.<br>
<br>
105:8 He hath remembered his covenant for ever, the word which he commanded to a thousand generations.<br>
<br>
105:9 Which covenant he made with Abraham, and his oath unto Isaac;<br>
<br>
105:10 And confirmed the same unto Jacob for a law, and to Israel for an everlasting covenant:<br>
<br>
105:11 Saying, Unto thee will I give the land of Canaan, the lot of your inheritance:<br>
<br>
105:12 When they were but a few men in number; yea, very few, and strangers in it.<br>
<br>
105:13 When they went from one nation to another, from one kingdom to another people;<br>
<br>
105:14 He suffered no man to do them wrong: yea, he reproved kings for their sakes;<br>
<br>
105:15 Saying, Touch not mine anointed, and do my prophets no harm.<br>
<br>
105:16 Moreover he called for a famine upon the land: he brake the whole staff of bread.<br>
<br>
105:17 He sent a man before them, even Joseph, who was sold for a servant:<br>
<br>
105:18 Whose feet they hurt with fetters: he was laid in iron:<br>
<br>
105:19 Until the time that his word came: the word of the LORD tried him.<br>
<br>
105:20 The king sent and loosed him; even the ruler of the people, and let him go free.<br>
<br>
105:21 He made him lord of his house, and ruler of all his substance:<br>
<br>
105:22 To bind his princes at his pleasure; and teach his senators wisdom.<br>
<br>
105:23 Israel also came into Egypt; and Jacob sojourned in the land of Ham.<br>
<br>
105:24 And he increased his people greatly; and made them stronger than their enemies.<br>
<br>
105:25 He turned their heart to hate his people, to deal subtilly with his servants.<br>
<br>
105:26 He sent Moses his servant; and Aaron whom he had chosen.<br>
<br>
105:27 They shewed his signs among them, and wonders in the land of Ham.<br>
<br>
105:28 He sent darkness, and made it dark; and they rebelled not against his word.<br>
<br>
105:29 He turned their waters into blood, and slew their fish.<br>
<br>
105:30 Their land brought forth frogs in abundance, in the chambers of their kings.<br>
<br>
105:31 He spake, and there came divers sorts of flies, and lice in all their coasts.<br>
<br>
105:32 He gave them hail for rain, and flaming fire in their land.<br>
<br>
105:33 He smote their vines also and their fig trees; and brake the trees of their coasts.<br>
<br>
105:34 He spake, and the locusts came, and caterpillers, and that without number,<br>
<br>
105:35 And did eat up all the herbs in their land, and devoured the fruit of their ground.<br>
<br>
105:36 He smote also all the firstborn in their land, the chief of all their strength.<br>
<br>
105:37 He brought them forth also with silver and gold: and there was not one feeble person among their tribes.<br>
<br>
105:38 Egypt was glad when they departed: for the fear of them fell upon them.<br>
<br>
105:39 He spread a cloud for a covering; and fire to give light in the night.<br>
<br>
105:40 The people asked, and he brought quails, and satisfied them with the bread of heaven.<br>
<br>
105:41 He opened the rock, and the waters gushed out; they ran in the dry places like a river.<br>
<br>
105:42 For he remembered his holy promise, and Abraham his servant.<br>
<br>
105:43 And he brought forth his people with joy, and his chosen with gladness:<br>
<br>
105:44 And gave them the lands of the heathen: and they inherited the labour of the people;<br>
<br>
105:45 That they might observe his statutes, and keep his laws. Praise ye the LORD.<br>
