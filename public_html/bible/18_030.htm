<blockquote>
30:1 But now they that are younger than I have me in derision, whose fathers I would have disdained to have set with the dogs of my flock.<br>
<br>
30:2 Yea, whereto might the strength of their hands profit me, in whom old age was perished?<br>
<br>
30:3 For want and famine they were solitary; fleeing into the wilderness in former time desolate and waste.<br>
<br>
30:4 Who cut up mallows by the bushes, and juniper roots for their meat.<br>
<br>
30:5 They were driven forth from among men, (they cried after them as after a thief;)<br>
<br>
30:6 To dwell in the cliffs of the valleys, in caves of the earth, and in the rocks.<br>
<br>
30:7 Among the bushes they brayed; under the nettles they were gathered together.<br>
<br>
30:8 They were children of fools, yea, children of base men: they were viler than the earth.<br>
<br>
30:9 And now am I their song, yea, I am their byword.<br>
<br>
30:10 They abhor me, they flee far from me, and spare not to spit in my face.<br>
<br>
30:11 Because he hath loosed my cord, and afflicted me, they have also let loose the bridle before me.<br>
<br>
30:12 Upon my right hand rise the youth; they push away my feet, and they raise up against me the ways of their destruction.<br>
<br>
30:13 They mar my path, they set forward my calamity, they have no helper.<br>
<br>
30:14 They came upon me as a wide breaking in of waters: in the desolation they rolled themselves upon me.<br>
<br>
30:15 Terrors are turned upon me: they pursue my soul as the wind: and my welfare passeth away as a cloud.<br>
<br>
30:16 And now my soul is poured out upon me; the days of affliction have taken hold upon me.<br>
<br>
30:17 My bones are pierced in me in the night season: and my sinews take no rest.<br>
<br>
30:18 By the great force of my disease is my garment changed: it bindeth me about as the collar of my coat.<br>
<br>
30:19 He hath cast me into the mire, and I am become like dust and ashes.<br>
<br>
30:20 I cry unto thee, and thou dost not hear me: I stand up, and thou regardest me not.<br>
<br>
30:21 Thou art become cruel to me: with thy strong hand thou opposest thyself against me.<br>
<br>
30:22 Thou liftest me up to the wind; thou causest me to ride upon it, and dissolvest my substance.<br>
<br>
30:23 For I know that thou wilt bring me to death, and to the house appointed for all living.<br>
<br>
30:24 Howbeit he will not stretch out his hand to the grave, though they cry in his destruction.<br>
<br>
30:25 Did not I weep for him that was in trouble? was not my soul grieved for the poor?<br>
<br>
30:26 When I looked for good, then evil came unto me: and when I waited for light, there came darkness.<br>
<br>
30:27 My bowels boiled, and rested not: the days of affliction prevented me.<br>
<br>
30:28 I went mourning without the sun: I stood up, and I cried in the congregation.<br>
<br>
30:29 I am a brother to dragons, and a companion to owls.<br>
<br>
30:30 My skin is black upon me, and my bones are burned with heat.<br>
<br>
30:31 My harp also is turned to mourning, and my organ into the voice of them that weep.<br>
<br>
