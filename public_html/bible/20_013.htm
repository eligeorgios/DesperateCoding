<br>
13:4 The soul of the sluggard desireth, and hath nothing: but the soul of the diligent shall be made fat.<br>
<br>
13:5 A righteous man hateth lying: but a wicked man is loathsome, and cometh to shame.<br>
<br>
13:6 Righteousness keepeth him that is upright in the way: but wickedness overthroweth the sinner.<br>
<br>
13:7 There is that maketh himself rich, yet hath nothing: there is that maketh himself poor, yet hath great riches.<br>
<br>
13:8 The ransom of a man's life are his riches: but the poor heareth not rebuke.<br>
<br>

<br>
13:10 Only by pride cometh contention: but with the well advised is wisdom.<br>
<br>
13:11 Wealth gotten by vanity shall be diminished: but he that gathereth by labour shall increase.<br>
<br>
13:12 Hope deferred maketh the heart sick: but when the desire cometh, it is a tree of life.<br>
<br>
13:13 Whoso despiseth the word shall be destroyed: but he that feareth the commandment shall be rewarded.<br>
<br>
13:14 The law of the wise is a fountain of life, to depart from the snares of death.<br>
<br>
13:15 Good understanding giveth favour: but the way of transgressors is hard.<br>
<br>
13:16 Every prudent man dealeth with knowledge: but a fool layeth open his folly.<br>
<br>
13:17 A wicked messenger falleth into mischief: but a faithful ambassador is health.<br>
<br>
13:18 Poverty and shame shall be to him that refuseth instruction: but he that regardeth reproof shall be honoured.<br>
<br>
13:19 The desire accomplished is sweet to the soul: but it is abomination to fools to depart from evil.<br>
<br>
13:20 He that walketh with wise men shall be wise: but a companion of fools shall be destroyed.<br>
<br>
13:21 Evil pursueth sinners: but to the righteous good shall be repayed.<br>
<br>
13:22 A good man leaveth an inheritance to his children's children: and the wealth of the sinner is laid up for the just.<br>
<br>
13:23 Much food is in the tillage of the poor: but there is that is destroyed for want of judgment.<br>
<br>
13:24 He that spareth his rod hateth his son: but he that loveth him chasteneth him betimes.<br>
<br>
13:25 The righteous eateth to the satisfying of his soul: but the belly of the wicked shall want.<br>
