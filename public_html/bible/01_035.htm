<blockquote>
35:1 And God said unto Jacob, Arise, go up to Bethel, and dwell there: and make there an altar unto God, that appeared unto thee when thou fleddest from the face of Esau thy brother.<br>
<br>
35:2 Then Jacob said unto his household, and to all that were with him, Put away the strange gods that are among you, and be clean, and change your garments:<br>
<br>
35:3 And let us arise, and go up to Bethel; and I will make there an altar unto God, who answered me in the day of my distress, and was with me in the way which I went.<br>
<br>
35:4 And they gave unto Jacob all the strange gods which were in their hand, and all their earrings which were in their ears; and Jacob hid them under the oak which was by Shechem.<br>
<br>
35:5 And they journeyed: and the terror of God was upon the cities that were round about them, and they did not pursue after the sons of Jacob.<br>
<br>
35:6 So Jacob came to Luz, which is in the land of Canaan, that is, Bethel, he and all the people that were with him.<br>
<br>
35:7 And he built there an altar, and called the place Elbethel: because there God appeared unto him, when he fled from the face of his brother.<br>
<br>
35:8 But Deborah Rebekah's nurse died, and she was buried beneath Bethel under an oak: and the name of it was called Allonbachuth.<br>
<br>
35:9 And God appeared unto Jacob again, when he came out of Padanaram, and blessed him.<br>
<br>
35:10 And God said unto him, Thy name is Jacob: thy name shall not be called any more Jacob, but Israel shall be thy name: and he called his name Israel.<br>
<br>
35:11 And God said unto him, I am God Almighty: be fruitful and multiply; a nation and a company of nations shall be of thee, and kings shall come out of thy loins;<br>
<br>
35:12 And the land which I gave Abraham and Isaac, to thee I will give it, and to thy seed after thee will I give the land.<br>
<br>
35:13 And God went up from him in the place where he talked with him.<br>
<br>
35:14 And Jacob set up a pillar in the place where he talked with him, even a pillar of stone: and he poured a drink offering thereon, and he poured oil thereon.<br>
<br>
35:15 And Jacob called the name of the place where God spake with him, Bethel.<br>
<br>
35:16 And they journeyed from Bethel; and there was but a little way to come to Ephrath: and Rachel travailed, and she had hard labor.<br>
<br>
35:17 And it came to pass, when she was in hard labor, that the midwife said unto her, Fear not; thou shalt have this son also.<br>
<br>
35:18 And it came to pass, as her soul was in departing, (for she died) that she called his name Benoni: but his father called him Benjamin.<br>
<br>
35:19 And Rachel died, and was buried in the way to Ephrath, which is Bethlehem.<br>
<br>
35:20 And Jacob set a pillar upon her grave: that is the pillar of Rachel's grave unto this day.<br>
<br>
35:21 And Israel journeyed, and spread his tent beyond the tower of Edar.<br>
<br>
35:22 And it came to pass, when Israel dwelt in that land, that Reuben went and lay with Bilhah his father's concubine: and Israel heard it. Now the sons of Jacob were twelve:<br>
<br>
35:23 The sons of Leah; Reuben, Jacob's firstborn, and Simeon, and Levi, and Judah, and Issachar, and Zebulun:<br>
<br>
35:24 The sons of Rachel; Joseph, and Benjamin:<br>
<br>
35:25 And the sons of Bilhah, Rachel's handmaid; Dan, and Naphtali:<br>
<br>
35:26 And the sons of Zilpah, Leah's handmaid: Gad, and Asher: these are the sons of Jacob, which were born to him in Padanaram.<br>
<br>
35:27 And Jacob came unto Isaac his father unto Mamre, unto the city of Arba, which is Hebron, where Abraham and Isaac sojourned.<br>
<br>
35:28 And the days of Isaac were an hundred and fourscore years.<br>
<br>
35:29 And Isaac gave up the ghost, and died, and was gathered unto his people, being old and full of days: and his sons Esau and Jacob buried him.<br>
