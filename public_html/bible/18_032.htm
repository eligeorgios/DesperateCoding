<blockquote>
32:1 So these three men ceased to answer Job, because he was righteous in his own eyes.<br>
<br>
32:2 Then was kindled the wrath of Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite, of the kindred of Ram: against Job was his wrath kindled, because he justified himself rather than God.<br>
<br>
32:3 Also against his three friends was his wrath kindled, because they had found no answer, and yet had condemned Job.<br>
<br>
32:4 Now Elihu had waited till Job had spoken, because they were elder than he.<br>
<br>
32:5 When Elihu saw that there was no answer in the mouth of these three men, then his wrath was kindled.<br>
<br>
32:6 And Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite answered and said, I am young, and ye are very old; wherefore I was afraid, and durst not shew you mine opinion.<br>
<br>
32:7 I said, Days should speak, and multitude of years should teach wisdom.<br>
<br>
32:8 But there is a spirit in man: and the inspiration of the Almighty giveth them understanding.<br>
<br>
32:9 Great men are not always wise: neither do the aged understand judgment.<br>
<br>
32:10 Therefore I said, Hearken to me; I also will shew mine opinion.<br>
<br>
32:11 Behold, I waited for your words; I gave ear to your reasons, whilst ye searched out what to say.<br>
<br>
32:12 Yea, I attended unto you, and, behold, there was none of you that convinced Job, or that answered his words:<br>
<br>
32:13 Lest ye should say, We have found out wisdom: God thrusteth him down, not man.<br>
<br>
32:14 Now he hath not directed his words against me: neither will I answer him with your speeches.<br>
<br>
32:15 They were amazed, they answered no more: they left off speaking.<br>
<br>
32:16 When I had waited, (for they spake not, but stood still, and answered no more;)<br>
<br>
32:17 I said, I will answer also my part, I also will shew mine opinion.<br>
<br>
32:18 For I am full of matter, the spirit within me constraineth me.<br>
<br>
32:19 Behold, my belly is as wine which hath no vent; it is ready to burst like new bottles.<br>
<br>
32:20 I will speak, that I may be refreshed: I will open my lips and answer.<br>
<br>
32:21 Let me not, I pray you, accept any man's person, neither let me give flattering titles unto man.<br>
<br>
32:22 For I know not to give flattering titles; in so doing my maker would soon take me away.<br>
<br>
