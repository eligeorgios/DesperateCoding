<blockquote>
14:1 Every wise woman buildeth her house: but the foolish plucketh it down with her hands.<br>
<br>
14:2 He that walketh in his uprightness feareth the LORD: but he that is perverse in his ways despiseth him.<br>
<br>
14:3 In the mouth of the foolish is a rod of pride: but the lips of the wise shall preserve them.<br>
<br>
14:4 Where no oxen are, the crib is clean: but much increase is by the strength of the ox.<br>
<br>
14:5 A faithful witness will not lie: but a false witness will utter lies.<br>
<br>
14:6 A scorner seeketh wisdom, and findeth it not: but knowledge is easy unto him that understandeth.<br>
<br>
14:7 Go from the presence of a foolish man, when thou perceivest not in him the lips of knowledge.<br>
<br>
14:8 The wisdom of the prudent is to understand his way: but the folly of fools is deceit.<br>
<br>
14:9 Fools make a mock at sin: but among the righteous there is favour.<br>
<br>
14:10 The heart knoweth his own bitterness; and a stranger doth not intermeddle with his joy.<br>
<br>
14:11 The house of the wicked shall be overthrown: but the tabernacle of the upright shall flourish.<br>
<br>
14:12 There is a way which seemeth right unto a man, but the end thereof are the ways of death.<br>
<br>
14:13 Even in laughter the heart is sorrowful; and the end of that mirth is heaviness.<br>
<br>
14:14 The backslider in heart shall be filled with his own ways: and a good man shall be satisfied from himself.<br>
<br>
14:15 The simple believeth every word: but the prudent man looketh well to his going.<br>
<br>
14:16 A wise man feareth, and departeth from evil: but the fool rageth, and is confident.<br>
<br>
14:17 He that is soon angry dealeth foolishly: and a man of wicked devices is hated.<br>
<br>
14:18 The simple inherit folly: but the prudent are crowned with knowledge.<br>
<br>
14:19 The evil bow before the good; and the wicked at the gates of the righteous.<br>
<br>
14:20 The poor is hated even of his own neighbour: but the rich hath many friends.<br>
<br>
14:21 He that despiseth his neighbour sinneth: but he that hath mercy on the poor, happy is he.<br>
<br>
14:22 Do they not err that devise evil? but mercy and truth shall be to them that devise good.<br>
<br>
14:23 In all labour there is profit: but the talk of the lips tendeth only to penury.<br>
<br>
14:24 The crown of the wise is their riches: but the foolishness of fools is folly.<br>
<br>
14:25 A true witness delivereth souls: but a deceitful witness speaketh lies.<br>
<br>
14:26 In the fear of the LORD is strong confidence: and his children shall have a place of refuge.<br>
<br>
14:27 The fear of the LORD is a fountain of life, to depart from the snares of death.<br>
<br>
14:28 In the multitude of people is the king's honour: but in the want of people is the destruction of the prince.<br>
<br>
14:29 He that is slow to wrath is of great understanding: but he that is hasty of spirit exalteth folly.<br>
<br>
14:30 A sound heart is the life of the flesh: but envy the rottenness of the bones.<br>
<br>
14:31 He that oppresseth the poor reproacheth his Maker: but he that honoureth him hath mercy on the poor.<br>
<br>
14:32 The wicked is driven away in his wickedness: but the righteous hath hope in his death.<br>
<br>
14:33 Wisdom resteth in the heart of him that hath understanding: but that which is in the midst of fools is made known.<br>
<br>
14:34 Righteousness exalteth a nation: but sin is a reproach to any people.<br>
<br>
14:35 The king's favour is toward a wise servant: but his wrath is against him that causeth shame.<br>
