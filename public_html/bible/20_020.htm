<br>
20:11 Even a child is known by his doings, whether his work be pure, and whether it be right.<br>
<br>
20:12 The hearing ear, and the seeing eye, the LORD hath made even both of them.<br>
<br>
20:13 Love not sleep, lest thou come to poverty; open thine eyes, and thou shalt be satisfied with bread.<br>
<br>
20:14 It is naught, it is naught, saith the buyer: but when he is gone his way, then he boasteth.<br>
<br>
20:15 There is gold, and a multitude of rubies: but the lips of knowledge are a precious jewel.<br>
<br>
20:16 Take his garment that is surety for a stranger: and take a pledge of him for a strange woman.<br>
<br>
20:17 Bread of deceit is sweet to a man; but afterwards his mouth shall be filled with gravel.<br>
<br>
20:18 Every purpose is established by counsel: and with good advice make war.<br>
<br>
20:19 He that goeth about as a talebearer revealeth secrets: therefore meddle not with him that flattereth with his lips.<br>
<br>
20:20 Whoso curseth his father or his mother, his lamp shall be put out in obscure darkness.<br>
<br>
20:21 An inheritance may be gotten hastily at the beginning; but the end thereof shall not be blessed.<br>
<br>
20:22 Say not thou, I will recompense evil; but wait on the LORD, and he shall save thee.<br>
<br>
20:23 Divers weights are an abomination unto the LORD; and a false balance is not good.<br>
<br>
20:24 Man's goings are of the LORD; how can a man then understand his own way?<br>
<br>
20:25 It is a snare to the man who devoureth that which is holy, and after vows to make enquiry.<br>
<br>
20:26 A wise king scattereth the wicked, and bringeth the wheel over them.<br>
<br>
20:27 The spirit of man is the candle of the LORD, searching all the inward parts of the belly.<br>
<br>
20:28 Mercy and truth preserve the king: and his throne is upholden by mercy.<br>
<br>
20:29 The glory of young men is their strength: and the beauty of old men is the grey head.<br>
<br>
20:30 The blueness of a wound cleanseth away evil: so do stripes the inward parts of the belly.<br>
