<blockquote>
18:1 Now after this it came to pass, that David smote the Philistines, and subdued them, and took Gath and her towns out of the hand of the Philistines.<br>
<br>
18:2 And he smote Moab; and the Moabites became David's servants, and brought gifts.<br>
<br>
18:3 And David smote Hadarezer king of Zobah unto Hamath, as he went to stablish his dominion by the river Euphrates.<br>
<br>
18:4 And David took from him a thousand chariots, and seven thousand horsemen, and twenty thousand footmen: David also houghed all the chariot horses, but reserved of them an hundred chariots.<br>
<br>
18:5 And when the Syrians of Damascus came to help Hadarezer king of Zobah, David slew of the Syrians two and twenty thousand men.<br>
<br>
18:6 Then David put garrisons in Syriadamascus; and the Syrians became David's servants, and brought gifts. Thus the LORD preserved David whithersoever he went.<br>
<br>
18:7 And David took the shields of gold that were on the servants of Hadarezer, and brought them to Jerusalem.<br>
<br>
18:8 Likewise from Tibhath, and from Chun, cities of Hadarezer, brought David very much brass, wherewith Solomon made the brazen sea, and the pillars, and the vessels of brass.<br>
<br>
18:9 Now when Tou king of Hamath heard how David had smitten all the host of Hadarezer king of Zobah;<br>
<br>
18:10 He sent Hadoram his son to king David, to enquire of his welfare, and to congratulate him, because he had fought against Hadarezer, and smitten him; (for Hadarezer had war with Tou;) and with him all manner of vessels of gold and silver and brass.<br>
<br>
18:11 Them also king David dedicated unto the LORD, with the silver and the gold that he brought from all these nations; from Edom, and from Moab, and from the children of Ammon, and from the Philistines, and from Amalek.<br>
<br>
18:12 Moreover Abishai the son of Zeruiah slew of the Edomites in the valley of salt eighteen thousand.<br>
<br>
18:13 And he put garrisons in Edom; and all the Edomites became David's servants. Thus the LORD preserved David whithersoever he went.<br>
<br>
18:14 So David reigned over all Israel, and executed judgment and justice among all his people.<br>
<br>
18:15 And Joab the son of Zeruiah was over the host; and Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud, recorder.<br>
<br>
18:16 And Zadok the son of Ahitub, and Abimelech the son of Abiathar, were the priests; and Shavsha was scribe;<br>
<br>
18:17 And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over the Cherethites and the Pelethites; and the sons of David were chief about the king.<br>
