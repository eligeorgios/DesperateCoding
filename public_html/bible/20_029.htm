<br>
29:14 The king that faithfully judgeth the poor, his throne shall be established for ever.<br>
<br>
29:15 The rod and reproof give wisdom: but a child left to himself bringeth his mother to shame.<br>

29:16 When the wicked are multiplied, transgression increaseth: but the righteous shall see their fall.<br>
<br>
29:17 Correct thy son, and he shall give thee rest; yea, he shall give delight unto thy soul.<br>
<br>

29:19 A servant will not be corrected by words: for though he understand he will not answer.<br>
<br>
29:20 Seest thou a man that is hasty in his words? there is more hope of a fool than of him.<br>
<br>
29:21 He that delicately bringeth up his servant from a child shall have him become his son at the length.<br>
<br>
29:22 An angry man stirreth up strife, and a furious man aboundeth in transgression.<br>
<br>
29:23 A man's pride shall bring him low: but honour shall uphold the humble in spirit.<br>
<br>
29:24 Whoso is partner with a thief hateth his own soul: he heareth cursing, and bewrayeth it not.<br>
<br>
29:25 The fear of man bringeth a snare: but whoso putteth his trust in the LORD shall be safe.<br>
<br>
29:26 Many seek the ruler's favour; but every man's judgment cometh from the LORD.<br>
<br>
29:27 An unjust man is an abomination to the just: and he that is upright in the way is abomination to the wicked.<br>
