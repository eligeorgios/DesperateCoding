<blockquote>
9:1 And it came to pass on the eighth day, that Moses called Aaron and his sons, and the elders of Israel;<br>
<br>
9:2 And he said unto Aaron, Take thee a young calf for a sin offering, and a ram for a burnt offering, without blemish, and offer them before the LORD.<br>
<br>
9:3 And unto the children of Israel thou shalt speak, saying, Take ye a kid of the goats for a sin offering; and a calf and a lamb, both of the first year, without blemish, for a burnt offering;<br>
<br>
9:4 Also a bullock and a ram for peace offerings, to sacrifice before the LORD; and a meat offering mingled with oil: for to day the LORD will appear unto you.<br>
<br>
9:5 And they brought that which Moses commanded before the tabernacle of the congregation: and all the congregation drew near and stood before the LORD.<br>
<br>
9:6 And Moses said, This is the thing which the LORD commanded that ye should do: and the glory of the LORD shall appear unto you.<br>
<br>
9:7 And Moses said unto Aaron, Go unto the altar, and offer thy sin offering, and thy burnt offering, and make an atonement for thyself, and for the people: and offer the offering of the people, and make an atonement for them; as the LORD commanded.<br>
<br>
9:8 Aaron therefore went unto the altar, and slew the calf of the sin offering, which was for himself.<br>
<br>
9:9 And the sons of Aaron brought the blood unto him: and he dipped his finger in the blood, and put it upon the horns of the altar, and poured out the blood at the bottom of the altar:<br>
<br>
9:10 But the fat, and the kidneys, and the caul above the liver of the sin offering, he burnt upon the altar; as the LORD commanded Moses.<br>
<br>
9:11 And the flesh and the hide he burnt with fire without the camp.<br>
<br>
9:12 And he slew the burnt offering; and Aaron's sons presented unto him the blood, which he sprinkled round about upon the altar.<br>
<br>
9:13 And they presented the burnt offering unto him, with the pieces thereof, and the head: and he burnt them upon the altar.<br>
<br>
9:14 And he did wash the inwards and the legs, and burnt them upon the burnt offering on the altar.<br>
<br>
9:15 And he brought the people's offering, and took the goat, which was the sin offering for the people, and slew it, and offered it for sin, as the first.<br>
<br>
9:16 And he brought the burnt offering, and offered it according to the manner.<br>
<br>
9:17 And he brought the meat offering, and took an handful thereof, and burnt it upon the altar, beside the burnt sacrifice of the morning.<br>
<br>
9:18 He slew also the bullock and the ram for a sacrifice of peace offerings, which was for the people: and Aaron's sons presented unto him the blood, which he sprinkled upon the altar round about,<br>
<br>
9:19 And the fat of the bullock and of the ram, the rump, and that which covereth the inwards, and the kidneys, and the caul above the liver:<br>
<br>
9:20 And they put the fat upon the breasts, and he burnt the fat upon the altar:<br>
<br>
9:21 And the breasts and the right shoulder Aaron waved for a wave offering before the LORD; as Moses commanded.<br>
<br>
9:22 And Aaron lifted up his hand toward the people, and blessed them, and came down from offering of the sin offering, and the burnt offering, and peace offerings.<br>
<br>
9:23 And Moses and Aaron went into the tabernacle of the congregation, and came out, and blessed the people: and the glory of the LORD appeared unto all the people.<br>
<br>
9:24 And there came a fire out from before the LORD, and consumed upon the altar the burnt offering and the fat: which when all the people saw, they shouted, and fell on their faces.<br>
