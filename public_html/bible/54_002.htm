<blockquote>
2:1 I exhort therefore, that, first of all, supplications, prayers, intercessions, and giving of thanks, be made for all men;<br>
<br>
2:2 For kings, and for all that are in authority; that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life in all godliness and honesty.<br>
<br>
2:3 For this is good and acceptable in the sight of God our Saviour;<br>
<br>
2:4 Who will have all men to be saved, and to come unto the knowledge of the truth.<br>
<br>
2:5 For there is one God, and one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus;<br>
<br>
2:6 Who gave himself a ransom for all, to be testified in due time.<br>
<br>
2:7 Whereunto I am ordained a preacher, and an apostle, (I speak the truth in Christ, and lie not;) a teacher of the Gentiles in faith and verity.<br>
<br>
2:8 I will therefore that men pray every where, lifting up holy hands, without wrath and doubting.<br>
<br>
2:9 In like manner also, that women adorn themselves in modest apparel, with shamefacedness and sobriety; not with broided hair, or gold, or pearls, or costly array;<br>
<br>
2:10 But (which becometh women professing godliness) with good works.<br>
<br>
2:11 Let the woman learn in silence with all subjection.<br>
<br>
2:12 But I suffer not a woman to teach, nor to usurp authority over the man, but to be in silence.<br>
<br>
2:13 For Adam was first formed, then Eve.<br>
<br>
2:14 And Adam was not deceived, but the woman being deceived was in the transgression.<br>
<br>
2:15 Notwithstanding she shall be saved in childbearing, if they continue in faith and charity and holiness with sobriety.<br>
