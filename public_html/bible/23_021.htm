<blockquote>
21:1 The burden of the desert of the sea. As whirlwinds in the south pass through; so it cometh from the desert, from a terrible land.<br>
<br>
21:2 A grievous vision is declared unto me; the treacherous dealer dealeth treacherously, and the spoiler spoileth. Go up, O Elam: besiege, O Media; all the sighing thereof have I made to cease.<br>
<br>
21:3 Therefore are my loins filled with pain: pangs have taken hold upon me, as the pangs of a woman that travaileth: I was bowed down at the hearing of it; I was dismayed at the seeing of it.<br>
<br>
21:4 My heart panted, fearfulness affrighted me: the night of my pleasure hath he turned into fear unto me.<br>
<br>
21:5 Prepare the table, watch in the watchtower, eat, drink: arise, ye princes, and anoint the shield.<br>
<br>
21:6 For thus hath the LORD said unto me, Go, set a watchman, let him declare what he seeth.<br>
<br>
21:7 And he saw a chariot with a couple of horsemen, a chariot of asses, and a chariot of camels; and he hearkened diligently with much heed:<br>
<br>
21:8 And he cried, A lion: My lord, I stand continually upon the watchtower in the daytime, and I am set in my ward whole nights:<br>
<br>
21:9 And, behold, here cometh a chariot of men, with a couple of horsemen. And he answered and said, Babylon is fallen, is fallen; and all the graven images of her gods he hath broken unto the ground.<br>
<br>
21:10 O my threshing, and the corn of my floor: that which I have heard of the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, have I declared unto you.<br>
<br>
21:11 The burden of Dumah. He calleth to me out of Seir, Watchman, what of the night? Watchman, what of the night?<br>
<br>
21:12 The watchman said, The morning cometh, and also the night: if ye will enquire, enquire ye: return, come.<br>
<br>
21:13 The burden upon Arabia. In the forest in Arabia shall ye lodge, O ye travelling companies of Dedanim.<br>
<br>
21:14 The inhabitants of the land of Tema brought water to him that was thirsty, they prevented with their bread him that fled.<br>
<br>
21:15 For they fled from the swords, from the drawn sword, and from the bent bow, and from the grievousness of war.<br>
<br>
21:16 For thus hath the LORD said unto me, Within a year, according to the years of an hireling, and all the glory of Kedar shall fail:<br>
<br>
21:17 And the residue of the number of archers, the mighty men of the children of Kedar, shall be diminished: for the LORD God of Israel hath spoken it.<br>
