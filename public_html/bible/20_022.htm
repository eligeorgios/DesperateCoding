<br>
22:13 The slothful man saith, There is a lion without, I shall be slain in the streets.<br>
<br>
22:14 The mouth of strange women is a deep pit: he that is abhorred of the LORD shall fall therein.<br>
<br>
22:15 Foolishness is bound in the heart of a child; but the rod of correction shall drive it far from him.<br>
<br>
22:16 He that oppresseth the poor to increase his riches, and he that giveth to the rich, shall surely come to want.<br>
<br>
22:17 Bow down thine ear, and hear the words of the wise, and apply thine heart unto my knowledge.<br>
<br>
22:18 For it is a pleasant thing if thou keep them within thee; they shall withal be fitted in thy lips.<br>
<br>
22:19 That thy trust may be in the LORD, I have made known to thee this day, even to thee.<br>
<br>
22:20 Have not I written to thee excellent things in counsels and knowledge,<br>
<br>
22:21 That I might make thee know the certainty of the words of truth; that thou mightest answer the words of truth to them that send unto thee?<br>
<br>
22:22 Rob not the poor, because he is poor: neither oppress the afflicted in the gate:<br>
<br>
22:23 For the LORD will plead their cause, and spoil the soul of those that spoiled them.<br>
<br>
22:24 Make no friendship with an angry man; and with a furious man thou shalt not go:<br>
<br>
22:25 Lest thou learn his ways, and get a snare to thy soul.<br>
<br>
22:26 Be not thou one of them that strike hands, or of them that are sureties for debts.<br>
<br>
22:27 If thou hast nothing to pay, why should he take away thy bed from under thee?<br>
<br>
22:28 Remove not the ancient landmark, which thy fathers have set.<br>
<br>
22:29 Seest thou a man diligent in his business? he shall stand before kings; he shall not stand before mean men.<br>
