<blockquote>
15:1 Then answered Eliphaz the Temanite, and said,<br>
<br>
15:2 Should a wise man utter vain knowledge, and fill his belly with the east wind?<br>
<br>
15:3 Should he reason with unprofitable talk? or with speeches wherewith he can do no good?<br>
<br>
15:4 Yea, thou castest off fear, and restrainest prayer before God.<br>
<br>
15:5 For thy mouth uttereth thine iniquity, and thou choosest the tongue of the crafty.<br>
<br>
15:6 Thine own mouth condemneth thee, and not I: yea, thine own lips testify against thee.<br>
<br>
15:7 Art thou the first man that was born? or wast thou made before the hills?<br>
<br>
15:8 Hast thou heard the secret of God? and dost thou restrain wisdom to thyself?<br>
<br>
15:9 What knowest thou, that we know not? what understandest thou, which is not in us?<br>
<br>
15:10 With us are both the grayheaded and very aged men, much elder than thy father.<br>
<br>
15:11 Are the consolations of God small with thee? is there any secret thing with thee?<br>
<br>
15:12 Why doth thine heart carry thee away? and what do thy eyes wink at,<br>
<br>
15:13 That thou turnest thy spirit against God, and lettest such words go out of thy mouth?<br>
<br>
15:14 What is man, that he should be clean? and he which is born of a woman, that he should be righteous?<br>
<br>
15:15 Behold, he putteth no trust in his saints; yea, the heavens are not clean in his sight.<br>
<br>
15:16 How much more abominable and filthy is man, which drinketh iniquity like water?<br>
<br>
15:17 I will shew thee, hear me; and that which I have seen I will declare;<br>
<br>
15:18 Which wise men have told from their fathers, and have not hid it:<br>
<br>
15:19 Unto whom alone the earth was given, and no stranger passed among them.<br>
<br>
15:20 The wicked man travaileth with pain all his days, and the number of years is hidden to the oppressor.<br>
<br>
15:21 A dreadful sound is in his ears: in prosperity the destroyer shall come upon him.<br>
<br>
15:22 He believeth not that he shall return out of darkness, and he is waited for of the sword.<br>
<br>
15:23 He wandereth abroad for bread, saying, Where is it? he knoweth that the day of darkness is ready at his hand.<br>
<br>
15:24 Trouble and anguish shall make him afraid; they shall prevail against him, as a king ready to the battle.<br>
<br>
15:25 For he stretcheth out his hand against God, and strengtheneth himself against the Almighty.<br>
<br>
15:26 He runneth upon him, even on his neck, upon the thick bosses of his bucklers:<br>
<br>
15:27 Because he covereth his face with his fatness, and maketh collops of fat on his flanks.<br>
<br>
15:28 And he dwelleth in desolate cities, and in houses which no man inhabiteth, which are ready to become heaps.<br>
<br>
15:29 He shall not be rich, neither shall his substance continue, neither shall he prolong the perfection thereof upon the earth.<br>
<br>
15:30 He shall not depart out of darkness; the flame shall dry up his branches, and by the breath of his mouth shall he go away.<br>
<br>
15:31 Let not him that is deceived trust in vanity: for vanity shall be his recompence.<br>
<br>
15:32 It shall be accomplished before his time, and his branch shall not be green.<br>
<br>
15:33 He shall shake off his unripe grape as the vine, and shall cast off his flower as the olive.<br>
<br>
15:34 For the congregation of hypocrites shall be desolate, and fire shall consume the tabernacles of bribery.<br>
<br>
15:35 They conceive mischief, and bring forth vanity, and their belly prepareth deceit.<br>
<br>
