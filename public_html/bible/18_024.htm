<blockquote>
24:1 Why, seeing times are not hidden from the Almighty, do they that know him not see his days?<br>
<br>
24:2 Some remove the landmarks; they violently take away flocks, and feed thereof.<br>
<br>
24:3 They drive away the ass of the fatherless, they take the widow's ox for a pledge.<br>
<br>
24:4 They turn the needy out of the way: the poor of the earth hide themselves together.<br>
<br>
24:5 Behold, as wild asses in the desert, go they forth to their work; rising betimes for a prey: the wilderness yieldeth food for them and for their children.<br>
<br>
24:6 They reap every one his corn in the field: and they gather the vintage of the wicked.<br>
<br>
24:7 They cause the naked to lodge without clothing, that they have no covering in the cold.<br>
<br>
24:8 They are wet with the showers of the mountains, and embrace the rock for want of a shelter.<br>
<br>
24:9 They pluck the fatherless from the breast, and take a pledge of the poor.<br>
<br>
24:10 They cause him to go naked without clothing, and they take away the sheaf from the hungry;<br>
<br>
24:11 Which make oil within their walls, and tread their winepresses, and suffer thirst.<br>
<br>
24:12 Men groan from out of the city, and the soul of the wounded crieth out: yet God layeth not folly to them.<br>
<br>
24:13 They are of those that rebel against the light; they know not the ways thereof, nor abide in the paths thereof.<br>
<br>
24:14 The murderer rising with the light killeth the poor and needy, and in the night is as a thief.<br>
<br>
24:15 The eye also of the adulterer waiteth for the twilight, saying, No eye shall see me: and disguiseth his face.<br>
<br>
24:16 In the dark they dig through houses, which they had marked for themselves in the daytime: they know not the light.<br>
<br>
24:17 For the morning is to them even as the shadow of death: if one know them, they are in the terrors of the shadow of death.<br>
<br>
24:18 He is swift as the waters; their portion is cursed in the earth: he beholdeth not the way of the vineyards.<br>
<br>
24:19 Drought and heat consume the snow waters: so doth the grave those which have sinned.<br>
<br>
24:20 The womb shall forget him; the worm shall feed sweetly on him; he shall be no more remembered; and wickedness shall be broken as a tree.<br>
<br>
24:21 He evil entreateth the barren that beareth not: and doeth not good to the widow.<br>
<br>
24:22 He draweth also the mighty with his power: he riseth up, and no man is sure of life.<br>
<br>
24:23 Though it be given him to be in safety, whereon he resteth; yet his eyes are upon their ways.<br>
<br>
24:24 They are exalted for a little while, but are gone and brought low; they are taken out of the way as all other, and cut off as the tops of the ears of corn.<br>
<br>
24:25 And if it be not so now, who will make me a liar, and make my speech nothing worth?<br>
<br>
