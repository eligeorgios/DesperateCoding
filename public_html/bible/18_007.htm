<blockquote>
7:1 Is there not an appointed time to man upon earth? are not his days also like the days of an hireling?<br>
<br>
7:2 As a servant earnestly desireth the shadow, and as an hireling looketh for the reward of his work:<br>
<br>
7:3 So am I made to possess months of vanity, and wearisome nights are appointed to me.<br>
<br>
7:4 When I lie down, I say, When shall I arise, and the night be gone? and I am full of tossings to and fro unto the dawning of the day.<br>
<br>
7:5 My flesh is clothed with worms and clods of dust; my skin is broken, and become loathsome.<br>
<br>
7:6 My days are swifter than a weaver's shuttle, and are spent without hope.<br>
<br>
7:7 O remember that my life is wind: mine eye shall no more see good.<br>
<br>
7:8 The eye of him that hath seen me shall see me no more: thine eyes are upon me, and I am not.<br>
<br>
7:9 As the cloud is consumed and vanisheth away: so he that goeth down to the grave shall come up no more.<br>
<br>
7:10 He shall return no more to his house, neither shall his place know him any more.<br>
<br>
7:11 Therefore I will not refrain my mouth; I will speak in the anguish of my spirit; I will complain in the bitterness of my soul.<br>
<br>
7:12 Am I a sea, or a whale, that thou settest a watch over me?<br>
<br>
7:13 When I say, My bed shall comfort me, my couch shall ease my complaints;<br>
<br>
7:14 Then thou scarest me with dreams, and terrifiest me through visions:<br>
<br>
7:15 So that my soul chooseth strangling, and death rather than my life.<br>
<br>
7:16 I loathe it; I would not live alway: let me alone; for my days are vanity.<br>
<br>
7:17 What is man, that thou shouldest magnify him? and that thou shouldest set thine heart upon him?<br>
<br>
7:18 And that thou shouldest visit him every morning, and try him every moment?<br>
<br>
7:19 How long wilt thou not depart from me, nor let me alone till I swallow down my spittle?<br>
<br>
7:20 I have sinned; what shall I do unto thee, O thou preserver of men? why hast thou set me as a mark against thee, so that I am a burden to myself?<br>
<br>
7:21 And why dost thou not pardon my transgression, and take away my iniquity? for now shall I sleep in the dust; and thou shalt seek me in the morning, but I shall not be.<br>
<br>
