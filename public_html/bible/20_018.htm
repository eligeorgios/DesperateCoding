<blockquote>
18:1 Through desire a man, having separated himself, seeketh and intermeddleth with all wisdom.<br>
<br>
18:2 A fool hath no delight in understanding, but that his heart may discover itself.<br>
<br>
18:3 When the wicked cometh, then cometh also contempt, and with ignominy reproach.<br>
<br>
18:4 The words of a man's mouth are as deep waters, and the wellspring of wisdom as a flowing brook.<br>
<br>
18:5 It is not good to accept the person of the wicked, to overthrow the righteous in judgment.<br>
<br>
18:6 A fool's lips enter into contention, and his mouth calleth for strokes.<br>
<br>
18:7 A fool's mouth is his destruction, and his lips are the snare of his soul.<br>
<br>
18:8 The words of a talebearer are as wounds, and they go down into the innermost parts of the belly.<br>
<br>
18:9 He also that is slothful in his work is brother to him that is a great waster.<br>
<br>
18:10 The name of the LORD is a strong tower: the righteous runneth into it, and is safe.<br>
<br>
18:11 The rich man's wealth is his strong city, and as an high wall in his own conceit.<br>
<br>
18:12 Before destruction the heart of man is haughty, and before honour is humility.<br>
<br>
18:13 He that answereth a matter before he heareth it, it is folly and shame unto him.<br>
<br>
18:14 The spirit of a man will sustain his infirmity; but a wounded spirit who can bear?<br>
<br>
18:15 The heart of the prudent getteth knowledge; and the ear of the wise seeketh knowledge.<br>
<br>
18:16 A man's gift maketh room for him, and bringeth him before great men.<br>
<br>
18:17 He that is first in his own cause seemeth just; but his neighbour cometh and searcheth him.<br>
<br>
18:18 The lot causeth contentions to cease, and parteth between the mighty.<br>
<br>
18:19 A brother offended is harder to be won than a strong city: and their contentions are like the bars of a castle.<br>
<br>
18:20 A man's belly shall be satisfied with the fruit of his mouth; and with the increase of his lips shall he be filled.<br>
<br>
18:21 Death and life are in the power of the tongue: and they that love it shall eat the fruit thereof.<br>
<br>
18:22 Whoso findeth a wife findeth a good thing, and obtaineth favour of the LORD.<br>
<br>
18:23 The poor useth intreaties; but the rich answereth roughly.<br>
<br>
18:24 A man that hath friends must shew himself friendly: and there is a friend that sticketh closer than a brother.<br>
<br>
