<blockquote>
1:1 The proverbs of Solomon the son of David, king of Israel;<br>
<br>
1:2 To know wisdom and instruction; to perceive the words of understanding;<br>
<br>
1:3 To receive the instruction of wisdom, justice, and judgment, and equity;<br>
<br>
1:4 To give subtilty to the simple, to the young man knowledge and discretion.<br>
<br>
1:5 A wise man will hear, and will increase learning; and a man of understanding shall attain unto wise counsels:<br>
<br>
1:6 To understand a proverb, and the interpretation; the words of the wise, and their dark sayings.<br>
<br>
1:7 The fear of the LORD is the beginning of knowledge: but fools despise wisdom and instruction.<br>
<br>
1:8 My son, hear the instruction of thy father, and forsake not the law of thy mother:<br>
<br>
1:9 For they shall be an ornament of grace unto thy head, and chains about thy neck.<br>
<br>
1:10 My son, if sinners entice thee, consent thou not.<br>
<br>
1:11 If they say, Come with us, let us lay wait for blood, let us lurk privily for the innocent without cause:<br>
<br>
1:12 Let us swallow them up alive as the grave; and whole, as those that go down into the pit:<br>
<br>
1:13 We shall find all precious substance, we shall fill our houses with spoil:<br>
<br>
1:14 Cast in thy lot among us; let us all have one purse:<br>
<br>
1:15 My son, walk not thou in the way with them; refrain thy foot from their path:<br>
<br>
1:16 For their feet run to evil, and make haste to shed blood.<br>
<br>
1:17 Surely in vain the net is spread in the sight of any bird.<br>
<br>
1:18 And they lay wait for their own blood; they lurk privily for their own lives.<br>
<br>
1:19 So are the ways of every one that is greedy of gain; which taketh away the life of the owners thereof.<br>
<br>
1:20 Wisdom crieth without; she uttereth her voice in the streets:<br>
<br>
1:21 She crieth in the chief place of concourse, in the openings of the gates: in the city she uttereth her words, saying,<br>
<br>
1:22 How long, ye simple ones, will ye love simplicity? and the scorners delight in their scorning, and fools hate knowledge?<br>
<br>
1:23 Turn you at my reproof: behold, I will pour out my spirit unto you, I will make known my words unto you.<br>
<br>
1:24 Because I have called, and ye refused; I have stretched out my hand, and no man regarded;<br>
<br>
1:25 But ye have set at nought all my counsel, and would none of my reproof:<br>
<br>
1:26 I also will laugh at your calamity; I will mock when your fear cometh;<br>
<br>
1:27 When your fear cometh as desolation, and your destruction cometh as a whirlwind; when distress and anguish cometh upon you.<br>
<br>
1:28 Then shall they call upon me, but I will not answer; they shall seek me early, but they shall not find me:<br>
<br>
1:29 For that they hated knowledge, and did not choose the fear of the LORD:<br>
<br>
1:30 They would none of my counsel: they despised all my reproof.<br>
<br>
1:31 Therefore shall they eat of the fruit of their own way, and be filled with their own devices.<br>
<br>
1:32 For the turning away of the simple shall slay them, and the prosperity of fools shall destroy them.<br>
<br>
1:33 But whoso hearkeneth unto me shall dwell safely, and shall be quiet from fear of evil.<br>
<br>
