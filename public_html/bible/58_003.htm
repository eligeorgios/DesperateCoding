<blockquote>
3:1 Wherefore, holy brethren, partakers of the heavenly calling, consider the Apostle and High Priest of our profession, Christ Jesus;<br>
<br>
3:2 Who was faithful to him that appointed him, as also Moses was faithful in all his house.<br>
<br>
3:3 For this man was counted worthy of more glory than Moses, inasmuch as he who hath builded the house hath more honour than the house.<br>
<br>
3:4 For every house is builded by some man; but he that built all things is God.<br>
<br>
3:5 And Moses verily was faithful in all his house, as a servant, for a testimony of those things which were to be spoken after;<br>
<br>
3:6 But Christ as a son over his own house; whose house are we, if we hold fast the confidence and the rejoicing of the hope firm unto the end.<br>
<br>
3:7 Wherefore (as the Holy Ghost saith, To day if ye will hear his voice,<br>
<br>
3:8 Harden not your hearts, as in the provocation, in the day of temptation in the wilderness:<br>
<br>
3:9 When your fathers tempted me, proved me, and saw my works forty years.<br>
<br>
3:10 Wherefore I was grieved with that generation, and said, They do alway err in their heart; and they have not known my ways.<br>
<br>
3:11 So I sware in my wrath, They shall not enter into my rest.)<br>
<br>
3:12 Take heed, brethren, lest there be in any of you an evil heart of unbelief, in departing from the living God.<br>
<br>
3:13 But exhort one another daily, while it is called To day; lest any of you be hardened through the deceitfulness of sin.<br>
<br>
3:14 For we are made partakers of Christ, if we hold the beginning of our confidence stedfast unto the end;<br>
<br>
3:15 While it is said, To day if ye will hear his voice, harden not your hearts, as in the provocation.<br>
<br>
3:16 For some, when they had heard, did provoke: howbeit not all that came out of Egypt by Moses.<br>
<br>
3:17 But with whom was he grieved forty years? was it not with them that had sinned, whose carcases fell in the wilderness?<br>
<br>
3:18 And to whom sware he that they should not enter into his rest, but to them that believed not?<br>
<br>
3:19 So we see that they could not enter in because of unbelief.<br>
<br>
