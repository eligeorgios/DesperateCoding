<blockquote>
22:1 Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered and said,<br>
<br>
22:2 Can a man be profitable unto God, as he that is wise may be profitable unto himself?<br>
<br>
22:3 Is it any pleasure to the Almighty, that thou art righteous? or is it gain to him, that thou makest thy ways perfect?<br>
<br>
22:4 Will he reprove thee for fear of thee? will he enter with thee into judgment?<br>
<br>
22:5 Is not thy wickedness great? and thine iniquities infinite?<br>
<br>
22:6 For thou hast taken a pledge from thy brother for nought, and stripped the naked of their clothing.<br>
<br>
22:7 Thou hast not given water to the weary to drink, and thou hast withholden bread from the hungry.<br>
<br>
22:8 But as for the mighty man, he had the earth; and the honourable man dwelt in it.<br>
<br>
22:9 Thou hast sent widows away empty, and the arms of the fatherless have been broken.<br>
<br>
22:10 Therefore snares are round about thee, and sudden fear troubleth thee;<br>
<br>
22:11 Or darkness, that thou canst not see; and abundance of waters cover thee.<br>
<br>
22:12 Is not God in the height of heaven? and behold the height of the stars, how high they are!<br>
<br>
22:13 And thou sayest, How doth God know? can he judge through the dark cloud?<br>
<br>
22:14 Thick clouds are a covering to him, that he seeth not; and he walketh in the circuit of heaven.<br>
<br>
22:15 Hast thou marked the old way which wicked men have trodden?<br>
<br>
22:16 Which were cut down out of time, whose foundation was overflown with a flood:<br>
<br>
22:17 Which said unto God, Depart from us: and what can the Almighty do for them?<br>
<br>
22:18 Yet he filled their houses with good things: but the counsel of the wicked is far from me.<br>
<br>
22:19 The righteous see it, and are glad: and the innocent laugh them to scorn.<br>
<br>
22:20 Whereas our substance is not cut down, but the remnant of them the fire consumeth.<br>
<br>
22:21 Acquaint now thyself with him, and be at peace: thereby good shall come unto thee.<br>
<br>
22:22 Receive, I pray thee, the law from his mouth, and lay up his words in thine heart.<br>
<br>
22:23 If thou return to the Almighty, thou shalt be built up, thou shalt put away iniquity far from thy tabernacles.<br>
<br>
22:24 Then shalt thou lay up gold as dust, and the gold of Ophir as the stones of the brooks.<br>
<br>
22:25 Yea, the Almighty shall be thy defence, and thou shalt have plenty of silver.<br>
<br>
22:26 For then shalt thou have thy delight in the Almighty, and shalt lift up thy face unto God.<br>
<br>
22:27 Thou shalt make thy prayer unto him, and he shall hear thee, and thou shalt pay thy vows.<br>
<br>
22:28 Thou shalt also decree a thing, and it shall be established unto thee: and the light shall shine upon thy ways.<br>
<br>
22:29 When men are cast down, then thou shalt say, There is lifting up; and he shall save the humble person.<br>
<br>
22:30 He shall deliver the island of the innocent: and it is delivered by the pureness of thine hands.<br>
