<blockquote>
9:1 Then Job answered and said,<br>
<br>
9:2 I know it is so of a truth: but how should man be just with God?<br>
<br>
9:3 If he will contend with him, he cannot answer him one of a thousand.<br>
<br>
9:4 He is wise in heart, and mighty in strength: who hath hardened himself against him, and hath prospered?<br>
<br>
9:5 Which removeth the mountains, and they know not: which overturneth them in his anger.<br>
<br>
9:6 Which shaketh the earth out of her place, and the pillars thereof tremble.<br>
<br>
9:7 Which commandeth the sun, and it riseth not; and sealeth up the stars.<br>
<br>
9:8 Which alone spreadeth out the heavens, and treadeth upon the waves of the sea.<br>
<br>
9:9 Which maketh Arcturus, Orion, and Pleiades, and the chambers of the south.<br>
<br>
9:10 Which doeth great things past finding out; yea, and wonders without number.<br>
<br>
9:11 Lo, he goeth by me, and I see him not: he passeth on also, but I perceive him not.<br>
<br>
9:12 Behold, he taketh away, who can hinder him? who will say unto him, What doest thou?<br>
<br>
9:13 If God will not withdraw his anger, the proud helpers do stoop under him.<br>
<br>
9:14 How much less shall I answer him, and choose out my words to reason with him?<br>
<br>
9:15 Whom, though I were righteous, yet would I not answer, but I would make supplication to my judge.<br>
<br>
9:16 If I had called, and he had answered me; yet would I not believe that he had hearkened unto my voice.<br>
<br>
9:17 For he breaketh me with a tempest, and multiplieth my wounds without cause.<br>
<br>
9:18 He will not suffer me to take my breath, but filleth me with bitterness.<br>
<br>
9:19 If I speak of strength, lo, he is strong: and if of judgment, who shall set me a time to plead?<br>
<br>
9:20 If I justify myself, mine own mouth shall condemn me: if I say, I am perfect, it shall also prove me perverse.<br>
<br>
9:21 Though I were perfect, yet would I not know my soul: I would despise my life.<br>
<br>
9:22 This is one thing, therefore I said it, He destroyeth the perfect and the wicked.<br>
<br>
9:23 If the scourge slay suddenly, he will laugh at the trial of the innocent.<br>
<br>
9:24 The earth is given into the hand of the wicked: he covereth the faces of the judges thereof; if not, where, and who is he?<br>
<br>
9:25 Now my days are swifter than a post: they flee away, they see no good.<br>
<br>
9:26 They are passed away as the swift ships: as the eagle that hasteth to the prey.<br>
<br>
9:27 If I say, I will forget my complaint, I will leave off my heaviness, and comfort myself:<br>
<br>
9:28 I am afraid of all my sorrows, I know that thou wilt not hold me innocent.<br>
<br>
9:29 If I be wicked, why then labour I in vain?<br>
<br>
9:30 If I wash myself with snow water, and make my hands never so clean;<br>
<br>
9:31 Yet shalt thou plunge me in the ditch, and mine own clothes shall abhor me.<br>
<br>
9:32 For he is not a man, as I am, that I should answer him, and we should come together in judgment.<br>
<br>
9:33 Neither is there any daysman betwixt us, that might lay his hand upon us both.<br>
<br>
9:34 Let him take his rod away from me, and let not his fear terrify me:<br>
<br>
9:35 Then would I speak, and not fear him; but it is not so with me.<br>
<br>
