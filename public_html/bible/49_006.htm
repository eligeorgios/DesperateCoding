<blockquote>
6:1 Children, obey your parents in the Lord: for this is right.<br>
<br>
6:2 Honour thy father and mother; which is the first commandment with promise;<br>
<br>
6:3 That it may be well with thee, and thou mayest live long on the earth.<br>
<br>
6:4 And, ye fathers, provoke not your children to wrath: but bring them up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord.<br>
<br>
6:5 Servants, be obedient to them that are your masters according to the flesh, with fear and trembling, in singleness of your heart, as unto Christ;<br>
<br>
6:6 Not with eyeservice, as menpleasers; but as the servants of Christ, doing the will of God from the heart;<br>
<br>
6:7 With good will doing service, as to the Lord, and not to men:<br>
<br>
6:8 Knowing that whatsoever good thing any man doeth, the same shall he receive of the Lord, whether he be bond or free.<br>
<br>
6:9 And, ye masters, do the same things unto them, forbearing threatening: knowing that your Master also is in heaven; neither is there respect of persons with him.<br>
<br>
6:10 Finally, my brethren, be strong in the Lord, and in the power of his might.<br>
<br>
6:11 Put on the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil.<br>
<br>
6:12 For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places.<br>
<br>
6:13 Wherefore take unto you the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to withstand in the evil day, and having done all, to stand.<br>
<br>
6:14 Stand therefore, having your loins girt about with truth, and having on the breastplate of righteousness;<br>
<br>
6:15 And your feet shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace;<br>
<br>
6:16 Above all, taking the shield of faith, wherewith ye shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked.<br>
<br>
6:17 And take the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God:<br>
<br>
6:18 Praying always with all prayer and supplication in the Spirit, and watching thereunto with all perseverance and supplication for all saints;<br>
<br>
6:19 And for me, that utterance may be given unto me, that I may open my mouth boldly, to make known the mystery of the gospel,<br>
<br>
6:20 For which I am an ambassador in bonds: that therein I may speak boldly, as I ought to speak.<br>
<br>
6:21 But that ye also may know my affairs, and how I do, Tychicus, a beloved brother and faithful minister in the Lord, shall make known to you all things:<br>
<br>
6:22 Whom I have sent unto you for the same purpose, that ye might know our affairs, and that he might comfort your hearts.<br>
<br>
6:23 Peace be to the brethren, and love with faith, from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.<br>
<br>
6:24 Grace be with all them that love our Lord Jesus Christ in sincerity. Amen.<br>
<br>
