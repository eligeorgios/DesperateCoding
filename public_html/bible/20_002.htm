<blockquote>
2:1 My son, if thou wilt receive my words, and hide my commandments with thee;<br>
<br>
2:2 So that thou incline thine ear unto wisdom, and apply thine heart to understanding;<br>
<br>
2:3 Yea, if thou criest after knowledge, and liftest up thy voice for understanding;<br>
<br>
2:4 If thou seekest her as silver, and searchest for her as for hid treasures;<br>
<br>
2:5 Then shalt thou understand the fear of the LORD, and find the knowledge of God.<br>
<br>
2:6 For the LORD giveth wisdom: out of his mouth cometh knowledge and understanding.<br>
<br>
2:7 He layeth up sound wisdom for the righteous: he is a buckler to them that walk uprightly.<br>
<br>
2:8 He keepeth the paths of judgment, and preserveth the way of his saints.<br>
<br>
2:9 Then shalt thou understand righteousness, and judgment, and equity; yea, every good path.<br>
<br>
2:10 When wisdom entereth into thine heart, and knowledge is pleasant unto thy soul;<br>
<br>
2:11 Discretion shall preserve thee, understanding shall keep thee:<br>
<br>
2:12 To deliver thee from the way of the evil man, from the man that speaketh froward things;<br>
<br>
2:13 Who leave the paths of uprightness, to walk in the ways of darkness;<br>
<br>
2:14 Who rejoice to do evil, and delight in the frowardness of the wicked;<br>
<br>
2:15 Whose ways are crooked, and they froward in their paths:<br>
<br>
2:16 To deliver thee from the strange woman, even from the stranger which flattereth with her words;<br>
<br>
2:17 Which forsaketh the guide of her youth, and forgetteth the covenant of her God.<br>
<br>
2:18 For her house inclineth unto death, and her paths unto the dead.<br>
<br>
2:19 None that go unto her return again, neither take they hold of the paths of life.<br>
<br>
2:20 That thou mayest walk in the way of good men, and keep the paths of the righteous.<br>
<br>
2:21 For the upright shall dwell in the land, and the perfect shall remain in it.<br>
<br>
2:22 But the wicked shall be cut off from the earth, and the transgressors shall be rooted out of it.<br>
<br>
