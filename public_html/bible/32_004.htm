<blockquote>
4:1 But it displeased Jonah exceedingly, and he was very angry.<br>
<br>
4:2 And he prayed unto the LORD, and said, I pray thee, O LORD, was not this my saying, when I was yet in my country? Therefore I fled before unto Tarshish: for I knew that thou art a gracious God, and merciful, slow to anger, and of great kindness, and repentest thee of the evil.<br>
<br>
4:3 Therefore now, O LORD, take, I beseech thee, my life from me; for it is better for me to die than to live.<br>
<br>
4:4 Then said the LORD, Doest thou well to be angry?<br>
<br>
4:5 So Jonah went out of the city, and sat on the east side of the city, and there made him a booth, and sat under it in the shadow, till he might see what would become of the city.<br>
<br>
4:6 And the LORD God prepared a gourd, and made it to come up over Jonah, that it might be a shadow over his head, to deliver him from his grief. So Jonah was exceeding glad of the gourd.<br>
<br>
4:7 But God prepared a worm when the morning rose the next day, and it smote the gourd that it withered.<br>
<br>
4:8 And it came to pass, when the sun did arise, that God prepared a vehement east wind; and the sun beat upon the head of Jonah, that he fainted, and wished in himself to die, and said, It is better for me to die than to live.<br>
<br>
4:9 And God said to Jonah, Doest thou well to be angry for the gourd? And he said, I do well to be angry, even unto death.<br>
<br>
4:10 Then said the LORD, Thou hast had pity on the gourd, for the which thou hast not laboured, neither madest it grow; which came up in a night, and perished in a night:<br>
<br>
4:11 And should not I spare Nineveh, that great city, wherein are more then sixscore thousand persons that cannot discern between their right hand and their left hand; and also much cattle?<br>
