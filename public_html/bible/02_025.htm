<blockquote>
25:1 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,<br>
<br>
25:2 Speak unto the children of Israel, that they bring me an offering: of every man that giveth it willingly with his heart ye shall take my offering.<br>
<br>
25:3 And this is the offering which ye shall take of them; gold, and silver, and brass,<br>
<br>
25:4 And blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine linen, and goats' hair,<br>
<br>
25:5 And rams' skins dyed red, and badgers' skins, and shittim wood,<br>
<br>
25:6 Oil for the light, spices for anointing oil, and for sweet incense,<br>
<br>
25:7 Onyx stones, and stones to be set in the ephod, and in the breastplate.<br>
<br>
25:8 And let them make me a sanctuary; that I may dwell among them.<br>
<br>
25:9 According to all that I show thee, after the pattern of the tabernacle, and the pattern of all the instruments thereof, even so shall ye make it.<br>
<br>
25:10 And they shall make an ark of shittim wood: two cubits and a half shall be the length thereof, and a cubit and a half the breadth thereof, and a cubit and a half the height thereof.<br>
<br>
25:11 And thou shalt overlay it with pure gold, within and without shalt thou overlay it, and shalt make upon it a crown of gold round about.<br>
<br>
25:12 And thou shalt cast four rings of gold for it, and put them in the four corners thereof; and two rings shall be in the one side of it, and two rings in the other side of it.<br>
<br>
25:13 And thou shalt make staves of shittim wood, and overlay them with gold.<br>
<br>
25:14 And thou shalt put the staves into the rings by the sides of the ark, that the ark may be borne with them.<br>
<br>
25:15 The staves shall be in the rings of the ark: they shall not be taken from it.<br>
<br>
25:16 And thou shalt put into the ark the testimony which I shall give thee.<br>
<br>
25:17 And thou shalt make a mercy seat of pure gold: two cubits and a half shall be the length thereof, and a cubit and a half the breadth thereof.<br>
<br>
25:18 And thou shalt make two cherubim of gold, of beaten work shalt thou make them, in the two ends of the mercy seat.<br>
<br>
25:19 And make one cherub on the one end, and the other cherub on the other end: even of the mercy seat shall ye make the cherubim on the two ends thereof.<br>
<br>
25:20 And the cherubim shall stretch forth their wings on high, covering the mercy seat with their wings, and their faces shall look one to another; toward the mercy seat shall the faces of the cherubim be.<br>
<br>
25:21 And thou shalt put the mercy seat above upon the ark; and in the ark thou shalt put the testimony that I shall give thee.<br>
<br>
25:22 And there I will meet with thee, and I will commune with thee from above the mercy seat, from between the two cherubim which are upon the ark of the testimony, of all things which I will give thee in commandment unto the children of Israel.<br>
<br>
25:23 Thou shalt also make a table of shittim wood: two cubits shall be the length thereof, and a cubit the breadth thereof, and a cubit and a half the height thereof.<br>
<br>
25:24 And thou shalt overlay it with pure gold, and make thereto a crown of gold round about.<br>
<br>
25:25 And thou shalt make unto it a border of an hand breadth round about, and thou shalt make a golden crown to the border thereof round about.<br>
<br>
25:26 And thou shalt make for it four rings of gold, and put the rings in the four corners that are on the four feet thereof.<br>
<br>
25:27 Over against the border shall the rings be for places of the staves to bear the table.<br>
<br>
25:28 And thou shalt make the staves of shittim wood, and overlay them with gold, that the table may be borne with them.<br>
<br>
25:29 And thou shalt make the dishes thereof, and spoons thereof, and covers thereof, and bowls thereof, to cover withal: of pure gold shalt thou make them.<br>
<br>
25:30 And thou shalt set upon the table showbread before me always.<br>
<br>
25:31 And thou shalt make a candlestick of pure gold: of beaten work shall the candlestick be made: his shaft, and his branches, his bowls, his knops, and his flowers, shall be of the same.<br>
<br>
25:32 And six branches shall come out of the sides of it; three branches of the candlestick out of the one side, and three branches of the candlestick out of the other side:<br>
<br>
25:33 Three bowls made like unto almonds, with a knop and a flower in one branch; and three bowls made like almonds in the other branch, with a knop and a flower: so in the six branches that come out of the candlestick.<br>
<br>
25:34 And in the candlesticks shall be four bowls made like unto almonds, with their knops and their flowers.<br>
<br>
25:35 And there shall be a knop under two branches of the same, and a knop under two branches of the same, and a knop under two branches of the same, according to the six branches that proceed out of the candlestick.<br>
<br>
25:36 Their knops and their branches shall be of the same: all it shall be one beaten work of pure gold.<br>
<br>
25:37 And thou shalt make the seven lamps thereof: and they shall light the lamps thereof, that they may give light over against it.<br>
<br>
25:38 And the tongs thereof, and the snuffdishes thereof, shall be of pure gold.<br>
<br>
25:39 Of a talent of pure gold shall he make it, with all these vessels.<br>
<br>
25:40 And look that thou make them after their pattern, which was showed thee in the mount.<br>
