<blockquote>
19:1 Then Job answered and said,<br>
<br>
19:2 How long will ye vex my soul, and break me in pieces with words?<br>
<br>
19:3 These ten times have ye reproached me: ye are not ashamed that ye make yourselves strange to me.<br>
<br>
19:4 And be it indeed that I have erred, mine error remaineth with myself.<br>
<br>
19:5 If indeed ye will magnify yourselves against me, and plead against me my reproach:<br>
<br>
19:6 Know now that God hath overthrown me, and hath compassed me with his net.<br>
<br>
19:7 Behold, I cry out of wrong, but I am not heard: I cry aloud, but there is no judgment.<br>
<br>
19:8 He hath fenced up my way that I cannot pass, and he hath set darkness in my paths.<br>
<br>
19:9 He hath stripped me of my glory, and taken the crown from my head.<br>
<br>
19:10 He hath destroyed me on every side, and I am gone: and mine hope hath he removed like a tree.<br>
<br>
19:11 He hath also kindled his wrath against me, and he counteth me unto him as one of his enemies.<br>
<br>
19:12 His troops come together, and raise up their way against me, and encamp round about my tabernacle.<br>
<br>
19:13 He hath put my brethren far from me, and mine acquaintance are verily estranged from me.<br>
<br>
19:14 My kinsfolk have failed, and my familiar friends have forgotten me.<br>
<br>
19:15 They that dwell in mine house, and my maids, count me for a stranger: I am an alien in their sight.<br>
<br>
19:16 I called my servant, and he gave me no answer; I intreated him with my mouth.<br>
<br>
19:17 My breath is strange to my wife, though I intreated for the children's sake of mine own body.<br>
<br>
19:18 Yea, young children despised me; I arose, and they spake against me.<br>
<br>
19:19 All my inward friends abhorred me: and they whom I loved are turned against me.<br>
<br>
19:20 My bone cleaveth to my skin and to my flesh, and I am escaped with the skin of my teeth.<br>
<br>
19:21 Have pity upon me, have pity upon me, O ye my friends; for the hand of God hath touched me.<br>
<br>
19:22 Why do ye persecute me as God, and are not satisfied with my flesh?<br>
<br>
19:23 Oh that my words were now written! oh that they were printed in a book!<br>
<br>
19:24 That they were graven with an iron pen and lead in the rock for ever!<br>
<br>
19:25 For I know that my redeemer liveth, and that he shall stand at the latter day upon the earth:<br>
<br>
19:26 And though after my skin worms destroy this body, yet in my flesh shall I see God:<br>
<br>
19:27 Whom I shall see for myself, and mine eyes shall behold, and not another; though my reins be consumed within me.<br>
<br>
19:28 But ye should say, Why persecute we him, seeing the root of the matter is found in me?<br>
<br>
19:29 Be ye afraid of the sword: for wrath bringeth the punishments of the sword, that ye may know there is a judgment.<br>
<br>
