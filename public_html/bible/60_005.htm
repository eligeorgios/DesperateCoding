<blockquote>
5:1 The elders which are among you I exhort, who am also an elder, and a witness of the sufferings of Christ, and also a partaker of the glory that shall be revealed:<br>
<br>
5:2 Feed the flock of God which is among you, taking the oversight thereof, not by constraint, but willingly; not for filthy lucre, but of a ready mind;<br>
<br>
5:3 Neither as being lords over God's heritage, but being ensamples to the flock.<br>
<br>
5:4 And when the chief Shepherd shall appear, ye shall receive a crown of glory that fadeth not away.<br>
<br>
5:5 Likewise, ye younger, submit yourselves unto the elder. Yea, all of you be subject one to another, and be clothed with humility: for God resisteth the proud, and giveth grace to the humble.<br>
<br>
5:6 Humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of God, that he may exalt you in due time:<br>
<br>
5:7 Casting all your care upon him; for he careth for you.<br>
<br>
5:8 Be sober, be vigilant; because your adversary the devil, as a roaring lion, walketh about, seeking whom he may devour:<br>
<br>
5:9 Whom resist stedfast in the faith, knowing that the same afflictions are accomplished in your brethren that are in the world.<br>
<br>
5:10 But the God of all grace, who hath called us unto his eternal glory by Christ Jesus, after that ye have suffered a while, make you perfect, stablish, strengthen, settle you.<br>
<br>
5:11 To him be glory and dominion for ever and ever. Amen.<br>
<br>
5:12 By Silvanus, a faithful brother unto you, as I suppose, I have written briefly, exhorting, and testifying that this is the true grace of God wherein ye stand.<br>
<br>
5:13 The church that is at Babylon, elected together with you, saluteth you; and so doth Marcus my son.<br>
<br>
5:14 Greet ye one another with a kiss of charity. Peace be with you all that are in Christ Jesus. Amen.<br>
