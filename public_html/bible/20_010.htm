<blockquote>
10:1 The proverbs of Solomon. A wise son maketh a glad father: but a foolish son is the heaviness of his mother.<br>
<br>
10:2 Treasures of wickedness profit nothing: but righteousness delivereth from death.<br>
<br>
10:3 The LORD will not suffer the soul of the righteous to famish: but he casteth away the substance of the wicked.<br>
<br>
10:4 He becometh poor that dealeth with a slack hand: but the hand of the diligent maketh rich.<br>
<br>
10:5 He that gathereth in summer is a wise son: but he that sleepeth in harvest is a son that causeth shame.<br>
<br>
10:6 Blessings are upon the head of the just: but violence covereth the mouth of the wicked.<br>
<br>
10:7 The memory of the just is blessed: but the name of the wicked shall rot.<br>
<br>
10:8 The wise in heart will receive commandments: but a prating fool shall fall.<br>
<br>
10:9 He that walketh uprightly walketh surely: but he that perverteth his ways shall be known.<br>
<br>
10:10 He that winketh with the eye causeth sorrow: but a prating fool shall fall.<br>
<br>
10:11 The mouth of a righteous man is a well of life: but violence covereth the mouth of the wicked.<br>
<br>
10:12 Hatred stirreth up strifes: but love covereth all sins.<br>
<br>
10:13 In the lips of him that hath understanding wisdom is found: but a rod is for the back of him that is void of understanding.<br>
<br>
10:14 Wise men lay up knowledge: but the mouth of the foolish is near destruction.<br>
<br>
10:15 The rich man's wealth is his strong city: the destruction of the poor is their poverty.<br>
<br>
10:16 The labour of the righteous tendeth to life: the fruit of the wicked to sin.<br>
<br>
10:17 He is in the way of life that keepeth instruction: but he that refuseth reproof erreth.<br>
<br>
10:18 He that hideth hatred with lying lips, and he that uttereth a slander, is a fool.<br>
<br>
10:19 In the multitude of words there wanteth not sin: but he that refraineth his lips is wise.<br>
<br>
10:20 The tongue of the just is as choice silver: the heart of the wicked is little worth.<br>
<br>
10:21 The lips of the righteous feed many: but fools die for want of wisdom.<br>
<br>
10:22 The blessing of the LORD, it maketh rich, and he addeth no sorrow with it.<br>
<br>
10:23 It is as sport to a fool to do mischief: but a man of understanding hath wisdom.<br>
<br>
10:24 The fear of the wicked, it shall come upon him: but the desire of the righteous shall be granted.<br>
<br>
10:25 As the whirlwind passeth, so is the wicked no more: but the righteous is an everlasting foundation.<br>
<br>
10:26 As vinegar to the teeth, and as smoke to the eyes, so is the sluggard to them that send him.<br>
<br>
10:27 The fear of the LORD prolongeth days: but the years of the wicked shall be shortened.<br>
<br>
10:28 The hope of the righteous shall be gladness: but the expectation of the wicked shall perish.<br>
<br>
10:29 The way of the LORD is strength to the upright: but destruction shall be to the workers of iniquity.<br>
<br>
10:30 The righteous shall never be removed: but the wicked shall not inhabit the earth.<br>
<br>
10:31 The mouth of the just bringeth forth wisdom: but the froward tongue shall be cut out.<br>
<br>
10:32 The lips of the righteous know what is acceptable: but the mouth of the wicked speaketh frowardness.<br>
