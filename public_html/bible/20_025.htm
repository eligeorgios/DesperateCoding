<blockquote>
25:1 These are also proverbs of Solomon, which the men of Hezekiah king of Judah copied out.<br>
<br>
25:2 It is the glory of God to conceal a thing: but the honour of kings is to search out a matter.<br>
<br>
25:3 The heaven for height, and the earth for depth, and the heart of kings is unsearchable.<br>
<br>
25:4 Take away the dross from the silver, and there shall come forth a vessel for the finer.<br>
<br>
25:5 Take away the wicked from before the king, and his throne shall be established in righteousness.<br>
<br>
25:6 Put not forth thyself in the presence of the king, and stand not in the place of great men:<br>
<br>
25:7 For better it is that it be said unto thee, Come up hither; than that thou shouldest be put lower in the presence of the prince whom thine eyes have seen.<br>
<br>
25:8 Go not forth hastily to strive, lest thou know not what to do in the end thereof, when thy neighbour hath put thee to shame.<br>
<br>
25:9 Debate thy cause with thy neighbour himself; and discover not a secret to another:<br>
<br>
25:10 Lest he that heareth it put thee to shame, and thine infamy turn not away.<br>
<br>
25:11 A word fitly spoken is like apples of gold in pictures of silver.<br>
<br>
25:12 As an earring of gold, and an ornament of fine gold, so is a wise reprover upon an obedient ear.<br>
<br>
25:13 As the cold of snow in the time of harvest, so is a faithful messenger to them that send him: for he refresheth the soul of his masters.<br>
<br>
25:14 Whoso boasteth himself of a false gift is like clouds and wind without rain.<br>
<br>
25:15 By long forbearing is a prince persuaded, and a soft tongue breaketh the bone.<br>
<br>
25:16 Hast thou found honey? eat so much as is sufficient for thee, lest thou be filled therewith, and vomit it.<br>
<br>
25:17 Withdraw thy foot from thy neighbour's house; lest he be weary of thee, and so hate thee.<br>
<br>
25:18 A man that beareth false witness against his neighbour is a maul, and a sword, and a sharp arrow.<br>
<br>
25:19 Confidence in an unfaithful man in time of trouble is like a broken tooth, and a foot out of joint.<br>
<br>
25:20 As he that taketh away a garment in cold weather, and as vinegar upon nitre, so is he that singeth songs to an heavy heart.<br>
<br>
25:21 If thine enemy be hungry, give him bread to eat; and if he be thirsty, give him water to drink:<br>
<br>
25:22 For thou shalt heap coals of fire upon his head, and the LORD shall reward thee.<br>
<br>
25:23 The north wind driveth away rain: so doth an angry countenance a backbiting tongue.<br>
<br>
25:24 It is better to dwell in the corner of the housetop, than with a brawling woman and in a wide house.<br>
<br>
25:25 As cold waters to a thirsty soul, so is good news from a far country.<br>
<br>
25:26 A righteous man falling down before the wicked is as a troubled fountain, and a corrupt spring.<br>
<br>
25:27 It is not good to eat much honey: so for men to search their own glory is not glory.<br>
<br>
25:28 He that hath no rule over his own spirit is like a city that is broken down, and without walls.<br>
<br>
