<blockquote>
14:1 O israel, return unto the LORD thy God; for thou hast fallen by thine iniquity.<br>
<br>
14:2 Take with you words, and turn to the LORD: say unto him, Take away all iniquity, and receive us graciously: so will we render the calves of our lips.<br>
<br>
14:3 Asshur shall not save us; we will not ride upon horses: neither will we say any more to the work of our hands, Ye are our gods: for in thee the fatherless findeth mercy.<br>
<br>
14:4 I will heal their backsliding, I will love them freely: for mine anger is turned away from him.<br>
<br>
14:5 I will be as the dew unto Israel: he shall grow as the lily, and cast forth his roots as Lebanon.<br>
<br>
14:6 His branches shall spread, and his beauty shall be as the olive tree, and his smell as Lebanon.<br>
<br>
14:7 They that dwell under his shadow shall return; they shall revive as the corn, and grow as the vine: the scent thereof shall be as the wine of Lebanon.<br>
<br>
14:8 Ephraim shall say, What have I to do any more with idols? I have heard him, and observed him: I am like a green fir tree. From me is thy fruit found.<br>
<br>
14:9 Who is wise, and he shall understand these things? prudent, and he shall know them? for the ways of the LORD are right, and the just shall walk in them: but the transgressors shall fall therein.<br>
<br>
