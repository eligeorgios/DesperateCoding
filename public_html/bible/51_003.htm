<blockquote>
3:1 If ye then be risen with Christ, seek those things which are above, where Christ sitteth on the right hand of God.<br>
<br>
3:2 Set your affection on things above, not on things on the earth.<br>
<br>
3:3 For ye are dead, and your life is hid with Christ in God.<br>
<br>
3:4 When Christ, who is our life, shall appear, then shall ye also appear with him in glory.<br>
<br>
3:5 Mortify therefore your members which are upon the earth; fornication, uncleanness, inordinate affection, evil concupiscence, and covetousness, which is idolatry:<br>
<br>
3:6 For which things' sake the wrath of God cometh on the children of disobedience:<br>
<br>
3:7 In the which ye also walked some time, when ye lived in them.<br>
<br>
3:8 But now ye also put off all these; anger, wrath, malice, blasphemy, filthy communication out of your mouth.<br>
<br>
3:9 Lie not one to another, seeing that ye have put off the old man with his deeds;<br>
<br>
3:10 And have put on the new man, which is renewed in knowledge after the image of him that created him:<br>
<br>
3:11 Where there is neither Greek nor Jew, circumcision nor uncircumcision, Barbarian, Scythian, bond nor free: but Christ is all, and in all.<br>
<br>
3:12 Put on therefore, as the elect of God, holy and beloved, bowels of mercies, kindness, humbleness of mind, meekness, longsuffering;<br>
<br>
3:13 Forbearing one another, and forgiving one another, if any man have a quarrel against any: even as Christ forgave you, so also do ye.<br>
<br>
3:14 And above all these things put on charity, which is the bond of perfectness.<br>
<br>
3:15 And let the peace of God rule in your hearts, to the which also ye are called in one body; and be ye thankful.<br>
<br>
3:16 Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom; teaching and admonishing one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing with grace in your hearts to the Lord.<br>
<br>
3:17 And whatsoever ye do in word or deed, do all in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God and the Father by him.<br>
<br>
3:18 Wives, submit yourselves unto your own husbands, as it is fit in the Lord.<br>
<br>
3:19 Husbands, love your wives, and be not bitter against them.<br>
<br>
3:20 Children, obey your parents in all things: for this is well pleasing unto the Lord.<br>
<br>
3:21 Fathers, provoke not your children to anger, lest they be discouraged.<br>
<br>
3:22 Servants, obey in all things your masters according to the flesh; not with eyeservice, as menpleasers; but in singleness of heart, fearing God;<br>
<br>
3:23 And whatsoever ye do, do it heartily, as to the Lord, and not unto men;<br>
<br>
3:24 Knowing that of the Lord ye shall receive the reward of the inheritance: for ye serve the Lord Christ.<br>
<br>
3:25 But he that doeth wrong shall receive for the wrong which he hath done: and there is no respect of persons.<br>
