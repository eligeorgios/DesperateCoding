<blockquote>
27:1 Boast not thyself of to morrow; for thou knowest not what a day may bring forth.<br>
<br>
27:2 Let another man praise thee, and not thine own mouth; a stranger, and not thine own lips.<br>
<br>
27:3 A stone is heavy, and the sand weighty; but a fool's wrath is heavier than them both.<br>
<br>
27:4 Wrath is cruel, and anger is outrageous; but who is able to stand before envy?<br>
<br>
27:5 Open rebuke is better than secret love.<br>
<br>
27:6 Faithful are the wounds of a friend; but the kisses of an enemy are deceitful.<br>
<br>
27:7 The full soul loatheth an honeycomb; but to the hungry soul every bitter thing is sweet.<br>
<br>
27:8 As a bird that wandereth from her nest, so is a man that wandereth from his place.<br>
<br>
27:9 Ointment and perfume rejoice the heart: so doth the sweetness of a man's friend by hearty counsel.<br>
<br>
27:10 Thine own friend, and thy father's friend, forsake not; neither go into thy brother's house in the day of thy calamity: for better is a neighbour that is near than a brother far off.<br>
<br>
27:11 My son, be wise, and make my heart glad, that I may answer him that reproacheth me.<br>
<br>
27:12 A prudent man foreseeth the evil, and hideth himself; but the simple pass on, and are punished.<br>
<br>
27:13 Take his garment that is surety for a stranger, and take a pledge of him for a strange woman.<br>
<br>
27:14 He that blesseth his friend with a loud voice, rising early in the morning, it shall be counted a curse to him.<br>
<br>
27:15 A continual dropping in a very rainy day and a contentious woman are alike.<br>
<br>
27:16 Whosoever hideth her hideth the wind, and the ointment of his right hand, which bewrayeth itself.<br>
<br>
27:17 Iron sharpeneth iron; so a man sharpeneth the countenance of his friend.<br>
<br>
27:18 Whoso keepeth the fig tree shall eat the fruit thereof: so he that waiteth on his master shall be honoured.<br>
<br>
27:19 As in water face answereth to face, so the heart of man to man.<br>
<br>
27:20 Hell and destruction are never full; so the eyes of man are never satisfied.<br>
<br>
27:21 As the fining pot for silver, and the furnace for gold; so is a man to his praise.<br>
<br>
27:22 Though thou shouldest bray a fool in a mortar among wheat with a pestle, yet will not his foolishness depart from him.<br>
<br>
27:23 Be thou diligent to know the state of thy flocks, and look well to thy herds.<br>
<br>
27:24 For riches are not for ever: and doth the crown endure to every generation?<br>
<br>
27:25 The hay appeareth, and the tender grass sheweth itself, and herbs of the mountains are gathered.<br>
<br>
27:26 The lambs are for thy clothing, and the goats are the price of the field.<br>
<br>
27:27 And thou shalt have goats' milk enough for thy food, for the food of thy household, and for the maintenance for thy maidens.<br>
<br>
