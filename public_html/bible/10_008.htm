<br>

<br>
8:11 Which also king David did dedicate unto the LORD, with the silver and gold that he had dedicated of all nations which he subdued;<br>
<br>
8:12 Of Syria, and of Moab, and of the children of Ammon, and of the Philistines, and of Amalek, and of the spoil of Hadadezer, son of Rehob, king of Zobah.<br>

<br>
8:15 And David reigned over all Israel; and David executed judgment and justice unto all his people.<br>
<br>
8:16 And Joab the son of Zeruiah was over the host; and Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud was recorder;<br>
