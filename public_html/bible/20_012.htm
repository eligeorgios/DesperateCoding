<blockquote>
12:1 Whoso loveth instruction loveth knowledge: but he that hateth reproof is brutish.<br>
<br>
12:2 A good man obtaineth favour of the LORD: but a man of wicked devices will he condemn.<br>
<br>
12:3 A man shall not be established by wickedness: but the root of the righteous shall not be moved.<br>
<br>
12:4 A virtuous woman is a crown to her husband: but she that maketh ashamed is as rottenness in his bones.<br>
<br>
12:5 The thoughts of the righteous are right: but the counsels of the wicked are deceit.<br>
<br>
12:6 The words of the wicked are to lie in wait for blood: but the mouth of the upright shall deliver them.<br>
<br>
12:7 The wicked are overthrown, and are not: but the house of the righteous shall stand.<br>
<br>
12:8 A man shall be commended according to his wisdom: but he that is of a perverse heart shall be despised.<br>
<br>
12:9 He that is despised, and hath a servant, is better than he that honoureth himself, and lacketh bread.<br>
<br>
12:10 A righteous man regardeth the life of his beast: but the tender mercies of the wicked are cruel.<br>
<br>
12:11 He that tilleth his land shall be satisfied with bread: but he that followeth vain persons is void of understanding.<br>
<br>
12:12 The wicked desireth the net of evil men: but the root of the righteous yieldeth fruit.<br>
<br>
12:13 The wicked is snared by the transgression of his lips: but the just shall come out of trouble.<br>
<br>
12:14 A man shall be satisfied with good by the fruit of his mouth: and the recompence of a man's hands shall be rendered unto him.<br>
<br>
12:15 The way of a fool is right in his own eyes: but he that hearkeneth unto counsel is wise.<br>
<br>
12:16 A fool's wrath is presently known: but a prudent man covereth shame.<br>
<br>
12:17 He that speaketh truth sheweth forth righteousness: but a false witness deceit.<br>
<br>
12:18 There is that speaketh like the piercings of a sword: but the tongue of the wise is health.<br>
<br>
12:19 The lip of truth shall be established for ever: but a lying tongue is but for a moment.<br>
<br>
12:20 Deceit is in the heart of them that imagine evil: but to the counsellors of peace is joy.<br>
<br>
12:21 There shall no evil happen to the just: but the wicked shall be filled with mischief.<br>
<br>
12:22 Lying lips are abomination to the LORD: but they that deal truly are his delight.<br>
<br>
12:23 A prudent man concealeth knowledge: but the heart of fools proclaimeth foolishness.<br>
<br>
12:24 The hand of the diligent shall bear rule: but the slothful shall be under tribute.<br>
<br>
12:25 Heaviness in the heart of man maketh it stoop: but a good word maketh it glad.<br>
<br>
12:26 The righteous is more excellent than his neighbour: but the way of the wicked seduceth them.<br>
<br>
12:27 The slothful man roasteth not that which he took in hunting: but the substance of a diligent man is precious.<br>
<br>
12:28 In the way of righteousness is life: and in the pathway thereof there is no death.<br>
