<blockquote>
3:1 This know also, that in the last days perilous times shall come.<br>
<br>
3:2 For men shall be lovers of their own selves, covetous, boasters, proud, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy,<br>
<br>
3:3 Without natural affection, trucebreakers, false accusers, incontinent, fierce, despisers of those that are good,<br>
<br>
3:4 Traitors, heady, highminded, lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God;<br>
<br>
3:5 Having a form of godliness, but denying the power thereof: from such turn away.<br>
<br>
3:6 For of this sort are they which creep into houses, and lead captive silly women laden with sins, led away with divers lusts,<br>
<br>
3:7 Ever learning, and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth.<br>
<br>
3:8 Now as Jannes and Jambres withstood Moses, so do these also resist the truth: men of corrupt minds, reprobate concerning the faith.<br>
<br>
3:9 But they shall proceed no further: for their folly shall be manifest unto all men, as their's also was.<br>
<br>
3:10 But thou hast fully known my doctrine, manner of life, purpose, faith, longsuffering, charity, patience,<br>
<br>
3:11 Persecutions, afflictions, which came unto me at Antioch, at Iconium, at Lystra; what persecutions I endured: but out of them all the Lord delivered me.<br>
<br>
3:12 Yea, and all that will live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution.<br>
<br>
3:13 But evil men and seducers shall wax worse and worse, deceiving, and being deceived.<br>
<br>
3:14 But continue thou in the things which thou hast learned and hast been assured of, knowing of whom thou hast learned them;<br>
<br>
3:15 And that from a child thou hast known the holy scriptures, which are able to make thee wise unto salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus.<br>
<br>
3:16 All scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness:<br>
<br>
3:17 That the man of God may be perfect, throughly furnished unto all good works.<br>
