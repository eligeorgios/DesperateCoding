<blockquote>
23:1 Then Job answered and said,<br>
<br>
23:2 Even to day is my complaint bitter: my stroke is heavier than my groaning.<br>
<br>
23:3 Oh that I knew where I might find him! that I might come even to his seat!<br>
<br>
23:4 I would order my cause before him, and fill my mouth with arguments.<br>
<br>
23:5 I would know the words which he would answer me, and understand what he would say unto me.<br>
<br>
23:6 Will he plead against me with his great power? No; but he would put strength in me.<br>
<br>
23:7 There the righteous might dispute with him; so should I be delivered for ever from my judge.<br>
<br>
23:8 Behold, I go forward, but he is not there; and backward, but I cannot perceive him:<br>
<br>
23:9 On the left hand, where he doth work, but I cannot behold him: he hideth himself on the right hand, that I cannot see him:<br>
<br>
23:10 But he knoweth the way that I take: when he hath tried me, I shall come forth as gold.<br>
<br>
23:11 My foot hath held his steps, his way have I kept, and not declined.<br>
<br>
23:12 Neither have I gone back from the commandment of his lips; I have esteemed the words of his mouth more than my necessary food.<br>
<br>
23:13 But he is in one mind, and who can turn him? and what his soul desireth, even that he doeth.<br>
<br>
23:14 For he performeth the thing that is appointed for me: and many such things are with him.<br>
<br>
23:15 Therefore am I troubled at his presence: when I consider, I am afraid of him.<br>
<br>
23:16 For God maketh my heart soft, and the Almighty troubleth me:<br>
<br>
23:17 Because I was not cut off before the darkness, neither hath he covered the darkness from my face.<br>
